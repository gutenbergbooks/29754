<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This volume is designed to meet a call from tourists who
are visiting the Whittier shrines at Haverhill and Amesbury
in numbers that are increasing year by year. Besides
describing the ancestral homestead and its surroundings,
and the home at Amesbury, an attempt is made to answer
such questions as naturally arise in regard to the localities
mentioned by Whittier in his ballads of the region. Many
anecdotes of the poet and several poems by him are now
first published. It is with some hesitancy that I have ventured
to add a chapter upon a phase of his character that
has never been adequately presented: I refer to his keen
sense of humor. It will be understood that none of the
impromptu verses I have given to illustrate his playful
moods were intended by him to be seen outside a small
circle of friends and neighbors. This playfulness, however,
was so much a part of his character from boyhood to old
age that I think it deserves some record such as is here
given.</p>

<p>For those who are interested to inquire to whom refer
passages in such poems as "Memories," "My Playmate,"
and "A Sea Dream," I now feel at liberty to give such
information as could not properly be given at the time
when I undertook the biography of the poet.</p>

<p>If any profit shall be derived from the sale of this book,
it will be devoted to the preservation and care of the
homes here described, which will ever be open to such
visitors as love the memory of Whittier.</p>

<h2><big>WHITTIER-LAND</big></h2>

<h2>I<br /><br />

HAVERHILL</h2>


<p>The whole valley of the Merrimac, from its source among
the New Hampshire hills to where it meets the ocean at
Newburyport, has been celebrated in Whittier's verse, and
might well be called "Whittier-Land." But the object of
these pages is to describe only that part of the valley included
in Essex County, the northeastern section of Massachusetts.
The border line separating New Hampshire
from the Bay State is three miles north of the river, and
follows all its turnings in this part of its course. For this
reason each town on the north of the Merrimac is but
three miles in width. It was on this three-mile strip that
Whittier made his home for his whole life. His birthplace
in Haverhill was his home for the first twenty-nine years
of his life. He lived in Amesbury the remaining fifty-six
years. The birthplace is in the East Parish of Haverhill,
three miles from the City Hall, and three miles from what
was formerly the Amesbury line. It is nearly midway
between the New Hampshire line and the Merrimac
River. In 1876 the township of Merrimac was formed
out of the western part of Amesbury, and this new town is
interposed between the two homes, which are nine miles
apart.</p>

<p>Haverhill, Merrimac, Amesbury, and Salisbury are each
on the three-mile-wide ribbon of land stretching to the
sea, on the left bank of the river. On the opposite bank
are Bradford, Groveland, Newbury, and Newburyport.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
The whole region on both sides of the river abounds in
beautifully rounded hills formed of glacial deposits of
clay and gravel, and they are fertile to their tops. At
many points they press close to the river, which has worn
its channel down to the sea-level, and feels the influence
of the tides beyond Haverhill. This gives picturesque
effects at many points. The highest of the hills have
summits about three hundred and sixty feet above the
surface of the river, and there are many little lakes and
ponds nestling in the hollows in every direction. In the
early days these hills were crowned with lordly growths of
oak and pine, and some of them still retain these adornments.
But most of the summits are now open pastures
or cultivated fields. The roofs and spires of prosperous
cities and villages are seen here and there among their
shade trees, and give a human interest to the lovely landscape.
It is not surprising that Whittier found inspiration
for the beautiful descriptive passages which occur in every
poem which has this river for theme or illustration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Stream of my fathers! sweetly still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sunset rays thy valley fill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured slantwise down the long defile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wave, wood, and spire beneath them smile."<br /></span>

<span class="caption">RIVER PATH</span>
</div>

<p>Here is a description of the scenery of the Merrimac
valley by Mr. Whittier himself, in a review of Rev. P. S.
Boyd's "Up and Down the Merrimac," written for a journal
with which I was connected, and never reprinted until
now:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The scenery of the lower valley of the Merrimac is
not bold or remarkably picturesque, but there is a great
charm in the panorama of its soft green intervales: its
white steeples rising over thick clusters of elms and
maples, its neat villages on the slopes of gracefully rounded
hills, dark belts of woodland, and blossoming or fruited
orchards, which would almost justify the words of one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
formerly sojourned on its banks, that the Merrimac is the
fairest river this side of Paradise. Thoreau has immortalized
it in his 'Week on the Concord and Merrimack
Rivers.' The late Caleb Cushing, who was not by nature
inclined to sentiment and enthusiasm, used to grow eloquent
and poetical when he spoke of his native river.
Brissot, the leader of the Girondists in the French Revolution,
and Louis Philippe, who were familiar with its scenery,
remembered it with pleasure. Anne Bradstreet, the
wife of Governor Bradstreet, one of the earliest writers of
verse in New England, sang of it at her home on its banks
at Andover; and the lovely mistress of Deer Island, who
sees on one hand the rising moon lean above the low sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
horizon of the east, and on the other the sunset reddening
the track of the winding river, has made it the theme and
scene of her prose and verse."</p></div>

<p>The visitor who approaches Whittier-Land by the way
of Haverhill will find in that city many places of interest
in connection with the poet's early life, and referred to
in his poems. The Academy for which he wrote the ode
sung at its dedication in 1827, when he was a lad of nineteen,
and before he had other than district school training,
is now the manual training school of the city, and may be
found, little changed except by accretion, on Winter Street,
near the city hall. As this ode does not appear in any of
his collected works, and is certainly creditable as a juvenile
production, it is given here. It was sung to the air
of "Pillar of Glory:"&mdash;</p>

<p>Haverhill, although but three miles wide, is ten miles
long, and includes many a fertile farm out of sight of
city spires, and out of sound of city streets. As Whittier
says in the poem "Haverhill:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>This "opulence of hill and lake" is the especial charm
of Haverhill. The two symmetrical hills, named Gold and
Silver, near the river, one above and one below the city
proper, are those referred to in "The Sycamores" as
viewed by Washington with admiring comment, standing
in his stirrups and</p>

<p>Silver Hill is the one with the tower on it. As one takes
at the railway station the electric car for the three-mile
trip to the Whittier birthplace, two lakes are soon passed
on the right. The larger one, overlooked by the stone
castle on top of a great hill embowered in trees, is Kenoza&mdash;a
name signifying pickerel. It was christened by
Whittier with the poem which has permanently fixed its
name. The whole lake and the beautiful wooded hills surrounding
it, with the picturesque castle crowning one of
them, are now included in a public park of which any city
might be proud. Our car passes close at hand, on the left,
another lake not visible because it is so much above
us. This is a singular freak of nature&mdash;a deep lake fed
by springs on top of a hill. The surface of this lake is
far above the tops of most of the houses of Haverhill,
and it is but a few rods from Kenoza, which lies almost
a hundred feet below. Our road is at middle height between
the two, and only a stone's throw from either.</p>

<p>As we approach the birthplace, it is over the northern
shoulder of Job's Hill, the summit of which is high above
us at the right. This hill was named for an Indian chief
of the olden time. We look down at the left into an idyllic
valley, and through the trees that skirt a lovely brook
catch sight of the ancient farmhouse on a gentle slope
which seems designed by nature for its reception. To
the west and south high hills crowd closely upon this
valley, but to the east are green meadows through which
winds, at last at leisure, the brook just released from its
tumble among the rocks of old Job's left shoulder. The
road by which we have come is comparatively new, and
was not in existence when the Whittiers lived here. The
old road crosses it close by the brook, which is here
bridged. The house faces the brook, and not the road,
presenting to the highway the little eastern porch that
gives entrance to the kitchen,&mdash;the famous kitchen of
"Snow-Bound."</p>

<p>The barn is across the road directly opposite this porch.
It is now much longer than it was in Whittier's youth, but
two thirds of it towards the road is the old part to which
the boys tunneled through the snowdrift&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">... "With merry din,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roused the prisoned brutes within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old horse thrust his long head out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grave with wonder gazed about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cock his lusty greeting said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth his speckled harem led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oxen lashed their tails, and hooked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mild reproach of hunger looked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hornéd patriarch of the sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Egypt's Amun roused from sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook his sage head with gesture mute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And emphasized with stamp of foot."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is not the original barn of the pioneers, but was
built by Whittier's father and uncle Moses in 1821. The
ancient barn was not torn down till some years later. It
was in what is now the orchard back of the house. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
used to be, close to the cattle-yard of the comparatively
new barn, a shop containing a blacksmith's outfit. This
was removed more than fifty years ago, being in a ruinous
condition from extreme old age. It had not been so
tenderly cared for as was its contemporary of the Stuart
times across the road.</p>

<p>Thomas Whittier, the pioneer, did not happen upon
this valley upon his first arrival from England, in 1638.
Indeed, at that time the settlements had not reached into
this then primeval wilderness. He settled first in that
part of Salisbury which is now named Amesbury, and
while a very young man represented that town in the
General Court. The Whittier Hill which overlooks the
poet's Amesbury home was named for the pioneer, and
not for his great-great-grandson. It is to this day called
by Amesbury people Whitcher Hill&mdash;as that appears to
have been the pronunciation of the name in the olden
time. For some reason he removed across the river to
Newbury. As a town official of Salisbury, he had occasion
to lay out a highway towards Haverhill&mdash;a road still
in use. He came upon a location that pleased his fancy,
and in 1647, at the age of twenty-seven, he returned to
the northern side of the river and built a log house on the
left bank of Country Brook, about a mile from the location
he selected in 1688 for his permanent residence. He
lived forty-one years in this log house, and here raised a
family of ten children, five of them stalwart boys, each
over six feet in height. He was sixty-eight years old when
he undertook to build the house now the shrine visited
yearly by thousands. In raising its massive oaken frame
he needed little help outside his own family. As to the
location of the log house, the writer of these pages visited
the spot with Mr. Whittier in search of it in 1882. He
said that when a boy he used to see traces of its foundation,
and hoped to find them again; but more than half a
century had passed in the mean time, and our search was
unsuccessful. It was on the ridge to the left of the road,
quite near the old Country Bridge.</p>

<span class="caption">THE HAUNTED BRIDGE OF COUNTRY BROOK</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>Country Bridge had the reputation of being haunted,
when Whittier was a boy, and several of his early uncollected
poems refer to this fact. No one who could
avoid it ventured over it after dark. He told me that
once he determined to swallow his fears and brave the
danger. He approached whistling to keep his courage
up, but a panic seized him, and he turned and ran home
without daring to look behind. It was in this vicinity
that Thomas Whittier built his first house in Haverhill.
Further down the stream was Millvale, where were three
mills, one a gristmill. This mill and the evil reputation
of the bridge are both referred to in these lines from
"The Home-Coming of the Bride," a fragment first
printed in "Life and Letters:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They passed the dam and the gray gristmill,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whose walls with the jar of grinding shook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crossed, for the moment awed and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The haunted bridge of the Country Brook."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>It was the custom of the pioneers, when they had the
choice, to select the sites of their homes near the small
water powers of the brooks; the large rivers they had
not then the power to harness. There were good mill sites
on Country Brook below the log house, but probably
some other settler had secured them, and Thomas Whittier
found in the smaller stream on his own estate a fairly
good water power. Fernside Brook is a tributary of Country
Brook. Probably this decided the selection of the
site for a house which was to be a home for generation
after generation of his descendants. The dam recently
restored is at the same spot where stood the Whittier mill,
and in making repairs some of the timbers of the ancient
mill were found. Parts of the original walls of the dam
are now to be seen on each side of the brook, but the
mill had disappeared long before Whittier was born.
Further up the brook were two other dams, used as reservoirs.
The lower dam when perfect was high enough
to enable the family to bring water to house and barn in
pipes.</p>

<p>When entering the grounds, notice the "bridle-post"
at the left of the gate, and a massive boulder in which
rude steps are cut for mounting a horse led up to its
side:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The bridle-post an old man sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loose-flung coat and high cocked hat."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Like all of Whittier's descriptions, this is an exact picture
of what he had in mind; for this stone, after a great
snowstorm, would assume just this appearance. As to the
phrase, "the well-curb had a Chinese roof," I once asked
him how this well could have had a roof, as the "long
sweep high aloof" would have interfered with it. He
stood by the side of the well, and explained that there
was no roof, but that there was a shelf on one side of the
curb on which to rest the bucket. The snow piled up on
this like a Chinese roof. The isolation of the homestead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
referred to in the phrase, "no social smoke curled over
woods of snow-hung oak," has not been broken in either
of the centuries this house has stood. No other house
was ever to be seen from it in any direction. And yet
neighbors are within a half-mile, only the hills and forests
hide their habitations from view. When the wind is right,
the bells of Haverhill may be faintly heard, and the roar
of ocean after a storm sometimes penetrates as a hoarse
murmur in this valley.</p>

<p>In the old days, before these hills were robbed of the
oaken growths that crowned their summits, their apparent
height was much increased, and the isolation rendered
even more complete than now. Sunset came much
earlier than it did outside this valley. The eastern hill,
beyond the meadow, is more distant and not so high, and
so the sunrises are comparatively early. Visitors interested
in geology will find this hill an unusually good
specimen of an eschar, a long ridge of glacial gravel set
down in a meadow through which Fernside Brook curves
on its way to its outlet in Country Brook. Job's Hill at
the south rises so steeply from the right bank of Fernside
Brook, at the foot of the terraced slope in front of the
house, that it is difficult for many rods to get a foothold.
The path by which the hill was scaled and the stepping-stones
by which the brook was crossed are accurately
sketched in the poem "Telling the Bees,"&mdash;a poem, by
the way, which originally had "Fernside" for its title:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here is the place; right over the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Runs the path I took;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You can see the gap in the old wall still,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the stepping-stones in the shallow brook."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Visitors should read the stanzas immediately following
this, and note the exactness of the poet's description of
the homestead he had in mind. The poem was written
more than twenty years after he left Haverhill, and it
was many years after that when Mr. Alfred Ordway, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
taking photographs of the place, noticed that it had already
been pictured in verse; when he spoke of it to
Mr. Whittier, the poet was both surprised and pleased at
this, which, he said, was the first recognition of his birthplace.
The public is indebted to Mr. Ordway for many
other discoveries of the same kind, illustrating Whittier's
minute fidelity to nature in his descriptions of scenery.</p>

</div>

<p>Let us enter the house by the eastern porch, noting
the circular door-stone, which was the millstone that
ground the grain of the pioneers, more than a century
before Whittier was born. It belonged in the mill on the
brook to which reference has been made. The fire which
destroyed the roof of the house in November, 1902, did
not injure this porch, and there were other parts of the
house which were scarcely scorched. These are the original
walls, and the handiwork of the pioneers is exactly
copied in whatever had to be restored. This was made
possible by photographs that had been kept, showing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
width and shape of every board and moulding, inside
and outside the house. Here again it is Mr. Ordway, president
of the board of trustees having the birthplace in
charge, who is to be especially thanked. It is proper
here, as I have spoken of the fire, to mention the heroic
work of the custodian, Mrs. Ela, and others, who saved
every article of the precious souvenirs endangered by the
fire, so that nothing was lost.</p>

<p>The kitchen, which occupies nearly the whole northern
side of the house, is twenty-six feet long and sixteen
wide. The visitor's attention is usually first drawn to the
great fireplace in the centre of its southern side. The central
chimney was built by the pioneer more than two centuries
ago, and it has five fireplaces opening into it. The
bricks of the kitchen hearth are much worn, as might be
expected from having served so many generations as the
centre of their home life. It was around this identical
hearth that the family was grouped, as sketched in the
great poem which has consecrated this room, and made
it a shrine toward which the pilgrims of many future generations
will find their way. Here was piled&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The oaken log, green, huge and thick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on its top the stout back-stick;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knotty forestick laid apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And filled between with curious art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ragged brush; then, hovering near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We watched the first red blaze appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On whitewashed wall and sagging beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the old, rude-furnished room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst, flower-like, into rosy bloom."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here on these very bricks simmered the mug of cider and
the "apples sputtered in a row," while through these
northern windows the homely scene was repeated on the
sparkling drifts in mimic flame. The table now standing
between these windows is the same that then stood there,
and many of the dishes on the shelves near by are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
family heirlooms occupying their old places. Two of these
pieces of china were brought here by Sarah Greenleaf,
Whittier's grandmother. The bull's-eye watch over the
mantel is a fine specimen of the olden time, and hangs
on the identical nail from which uncle Moses nightly suspended
his plump timepiece.</p>

<p>But perhaps the article which is most worthy of attention
in this room is the desk at the eastern corner. This
was the desk of Joseph Whittier, great-grandfather of the
poet, and son of the pioneer. On the backs and bottoms
of the drawers of this desk are farm memoranda made
with chalk much more than a century ago. One item
dated in 1798 records that the poet's father made his
last excursion to Canada in that year. It was about a
century old when the boy Whittier scribbled his first
rhymes upon it. By an interesting coincidence he also,
in his eighty-fifth year, wrote his very last poem upon it.
When the family removed to Amesbury, in 1836, this
desk was taken with them, but soon after was replaced
by a new one, and this went "out of commission." The
new desk was the one on which "Snow-Bound" was written,
and this may now be seen at Amesbury. When Mr.
Whittier's niece was married, he gave her this old desk,
which she took to Portland, where it was thoroughly repaired.
When he visited Portland, he wrote many letters
and some poems on it. In the summer of 1891, as her
uncle proposed to make his home with his cousins, the
Cartlands, in Newburyport, his niece had this ancient
desk sent there. Mr. Whittier was greatly pleased, upon
his arrival, to find in his room the heirloom which was
hallowed by so many associations connected not only
with his ancestry, but with his own early life. Nearly all
of the literary work of his last year was done upon this
desk. To his niece he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am writing at the old desk, which Gertrude has
placed in my room, but it seems difficult to imagine myself
the boy who used to sit by it and make rhymes. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
is wonderfully rejuvenated, and is a handsome piece of
furniture. It was the desk of my great-grandfather, and
seemed to me a wretched old wreck when thee took it to
Portland. I did not suppose it could be made either useful
or ornamental. I wrote my first pamphlet on slavery,
'Justice and Expediency,' upon it, as well as a great
many rhymes which might as well have never been written.
I am glad that it has got a new lease of life."</p>

<p>The little room at the western end of the kitchen was
"mother's room," its floor two steps higher than that of
the larger room, for a singular reason. In digging the
cellar the pioneer found here a large boulder it was inconvenient
to remove, and wishing a milk room at this
corner, he was obliged to make its floor two steps higher
than the rest of the cellar. This inequality is reproduced
in each story. In this little room the bed is furnished
with the blankets and linen woven by Whittier's mother
on the loom that used to stand in the open chamber. Her
initials "A. H." on some of the pieces show that they
date back to her life in Somersworth, N. H. On the wall
of this room may be seen the baby-clothes of Whittier's
father, made by the grandmother who brought the name
of Greenleaf into the family. The bureau in this room is
the one that stood there in the olden time. The little
mirror that stands on it is the one by which Whittier
shaved most of his life. He used it at Amesbury, and
possibly his father used it before him at Haverhill.</p>

<p>Mr. Whittier had a great fund of stories of the supernatural
that were current in this neighborhood in his
youth, and one that had this very kitchen for its scene,
he told with much impressiveness. It was the story of his
aunt Mercy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sweetest woman ever Fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perverse denied a household mate."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was out of this window in the kitchen that she saw the
horse and its rider coming down the road, and recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the young man to whom she was betrothed. It was out of
this window in the porch that she saw them again, as she
went to the door to welcome her lover. It was this door
she opened, to find no trace of horse or rider. It was to
this little room at the other end of the kitchen that she
went, bewildered and terrified, to waken her sister, who
tried in vain to pacify her by saying she had been dreaming
by the fire, when she should have been in bed. And it
was in this room she received the letter many days later
telling her of the death of her lover in a distant city at
the hour of her vision.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mr. Whittier told such stories with
the air of more than half belief in their truth, especially
in his later years, when he became interested in the researches
of scientists in the realm of telepathy. He said
his aunt was the most truthful of women, and she never
doubted the reality of her vision.</p>

<p>The door at the southwestern corner of the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
opens into the room in which the poet was born. This
was the parlor, but as the Friends were much given to
hospitality, it was often needed as a bedroom, and there
was in it a bedstead that could be lifted from the floor
and supported by a hook in the ceiling when not in use.
In the corners are cabinets containing articles of use and
ornament that are genuine relics of the Whittier family.
The inlaid mahogany card-table between the front windows
was brought to this house just a century ago (1804)
by Abigail Hussey, the bride of John Whittier, and placed
where it now stands. Like the desk in the kitchen, it has
always been in the possession of the family, and was restored
to the birthplace by the niece to whom Whittier
gave it. In this room are several books that belonged in
the small library of Whittier's father, which are mentioned
in "Snow-Bound," and described more fully in the rhymed
catalogue, a part of which appears in "Life and Letters,"
p. 46. I here give the full list copied from Whittier's manuscript,
for which I am indebted to Miss Sarah S. Thayer,
daughter of Abijah W. Thayer, who edited the "Haverhill
Gazette," and with whom Whittier boarded while in the
Academy. Mr. Thayer had appended to the manuscript
these words: "This was deposited in my hands about
1828, by John G. Whittier, who assured me that it was
his first effort at versification. It was written in 1823 or
1824, when Whittier was fifteen or sixteen years old."</p>

<p>The books of this library now to be seen are the "Life
of George Fox," in two leather-bound volumes, printed in
London, 1709, Sewel's "Painful History," printed in 1825,
Ellwood's "Drab-Skirted Muse," Philadelphia edition of
1775, and Thomas Clarkson's "Portraiture of Quakerism,"
New York edition of 1806.</p>

<p>The little red chest near the fireplace is an ancient relic
of the family, formerly used for storing linen. The portrait
of Whittier over the fireplace is enlarged from a
miniature painted by J. S. Porter about 1830, and it is
the earliest likeness of the poet ever taken. The original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
miniature may be seen at the Amesbury home. The large
portrait on the opposite side of the room was painted
by Joseph Lindon Smith, an artist of celebrity, who is a
relative of Whittier's. Portraits of Whittier's brother,
his sisters, his mother, and his old schoolmaster, Joshua
Coffin, are shown in this room. The silhouette on the
mantelpiece is of aunt Mercy, his mother's unmarried
sister. A sampler worked by Lydia Aver, the girl commemorated
in the poem "In School Days," is exhibited
in this room. She was a member of the family who were
the nearest neighbors of the Whittiers&mdash;a family still
represented in their ancient homestead, where her grandniece
now lives. She died at the age of fourteen.</p>

<p>It was the privilege of the writer to accompany Mr.
Whittier when he made his last visit to his birthplace, in
late October, 1882. When in this birth-room, he expressed
a wish to see again a fire upon its hearth, not for warmth,
for it was a warm day, but for the sentiment of it. The
elderly woman who had charge of the house said she
would have a fire built, and in the mean time we went
down to the brook, intending to cross by the stepping-stones
he had so often used. But the brook was running
full, the stepping-stones were slippery, and Mr. Whittier
reluctantly gave up crossing. Then we visited the little
burying-ground of the family, where lie the remains of his
ancestors. When we returned to the parlor, we found
the good woman had brought down a sheet-iron air-tight
stove from the attic, set it in the fireplace, and there was
a crackling fire in it! I suggested that we could easily
remove the stove and have a blaze on the hearth, but
Mr. Whittier at once negatived the proposition, saying
we must not let the woman know we were disappointed.
She had taken much pains to please us, and must not be
made aware of her mistake. He was always ready to
suffer inconvenience rather than wound the sensibilities
of any one.</p>

<p>From the back entry at the western end of the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
ascends the steep staircase down which Whittier, when an
infant, was rolled by his sister Mary, two years older than
he. She thought if he were well wrapped in a blanket he
would not be harmed, and the experiment proved quite
successful, thanks to her abundant care in bundling him
in many folds. He happily escaped one other peril in his
infancy. His parents took him with them on a winter
drive to Kingston, N. H. To protect him from the cold,
he was wrapped too closely in his blankets, and he came
so near asphyxiation that for a time he was thought to be
dead. He was taken into a farmhouse they were passing
when the discovery was made, and after a long and anxious
treatment they were delighted to find he was living.</p>

<p>The rooms in the upper part of the house injured by
the recent fire have been perfectly restored to their original
condition. At Whittier's last visit here he went into
every room, and told stories of the happenings of his youth
in each. At the head of the back stairs is a little doorless
press, which he pointed out as a favorite play-place of
his and his brother's. Here they found room for their
few toys, as perhaps three generations of Whittier children
had done before them. And it is not unlikely that
some of their toys had amused the youth of their grandfather.
One of his earliest memories is connected with
this little closet, for here he had his first severe twinge of
conscience. He had told a lie&mdash;no doubt a white one,
for it did not trouble him at first&mdash;and soon after was
watching the rising of a thunder-cloud that was grumbling
over the great trees on the western hill near at hand. A
bolt descended among the oaks, and the deafening explosion
was instantaneous. He saw in it an exhibition of
divine wrath over his sin, and obeyed the primal instinct
to hide himself. His mother, searching for him some time
after the storm had passed, found her repentant little
boy almost smothered under a quilt in this closet, and as
he confessed his sin, he was tenderly shrived. Here in
the open chamber the brothers often slept when visitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
claimed the little western chamber they usually occupied.
They would sometimes find, sifted through cracks in the
old walls, a little snowdrift on their quilt. The small
western room the boys called theirs was the scene of the
story Trowbridge has so neatly versified. The elder proposed
that as they could lift each other, by lifting in turn
they could rise to the ceiling, and there was no knowing
how much further if they were out of doors! The prudent
lads, to make it easy in case of failure, stood upon
the bed in this little room. Trowbridge says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Kind Nature smiled on that wise child,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor could her love deny him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The large fulfilment of his plan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since he who lifts his brother man<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In turn is lifted by him."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Boys were boys in those days, and Whittier told us of trying
to annoy his younger sister by pretending to hang
her cat on this railing to the attic stairs. And girls were
girls too; for he told of Elizabeth's frightening two hired
men who were occupying the open chamber. They had
been telling each other ghost stories after they went to
bed; but both asserted that they could not be frightened
by such things. From over the door of her room Elizabeth
began throwing pins, one at a time, so that they
would strike on the floor near the brave men. They were
so frightened they would not stay there another night. In
the open attic bunches of dried herbs hung from the rafters,
and traces of corn selected for seed. On the floor the
boys spread their store of nuts "from brown October's
wood." Originally the northern side of the roof sloped
down to the first story, as was the fashion in the days of
the Stuarts. But some years before Whittier's birth this
side of the roof was raised, giving much additional chamber
room.</p>

<p>Not far from the house, at the foot of the western hill,
is the small lot inclosed by a stone wall, to which reference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
has been made, that from the earliest settlement was
the burying-place of the family. Here lie the remains of
Thomas Whittier and those of his descendants who were
the ancestors of the poet. A plain granite shaft in the
centre of the lot is inscribed with the names of Thomas
Whittier and of Ruth Green, his wife; Joseph Whittier
and Mary Peaslee, his wife; Joseph Whittier, 2d, and
Sarah Greenleaf, his wife. No headstones mark the several
graves. Others of the family were buried here, including
Mary Whittier, an aunt of the poet. His father
and uncle Moses, originally buried here, were removed to
the Amesbury cemetery, when his mother died, in 1857.</p>

<p>Across the road from the house of the nearest neighbors,
the Ayers, in a field of the Whittier farm, is an old,
immense, and symmetrical tree, labeled "The Whittier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Elm," which the poet's schoolmate, Edmund Ayer, saved
from the woodman's axe by paying an annual tribute, at a
time when the farm had gone out of the possession of the
Whittiers, and while the new proprietors were intent upon
despoiling the place of its finest trees. This is the tree
referred to in these lines, written in 1862, in the album
of Lydia Amanda Ayer (now Mrs. Evans), his schoolmate
Lydia's niece:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whittier took us that October day to neighbor Ayer's
house, where the brother of little Lydia was still living,
who also was a schoolmate of the poet, and they talked
of the old times with the greatest relish. The Ayer house
occupies the site of a garrison house, built of strong oaken
timbers, and used as a house of refuge in the time of the
Indian wars. The Whittiers, though close at hand, never
availed themselves of its protection, even when Indian
faces covered with war-paint peered through the kitchen
windows upon the peaceful Quaker family. We were soon
joined by another aged schoolmate, Aaron Chase, and
with him we went to Corliss Hill, where Whittier showed
us the two houses in which he first went to school. They
are both now standing, and are dwelling-houses in each
of which a room was given up for the district school&mdash;one
before the house described in "In School Days" was
built, and the other while it was being repaired. He had
not yet arrived at school age when his sister Mary took
him to his first school, kept by his life-long friend, Joshua
Coffin, to whom he addressed the poem, "To My Old
Schoolmaster." As I happened to be a nephew of Coffin,
he told me stories of his first school. It was kept in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
unfinished ell of a farmhouse; but the room had been
transformed into a neatly furnished kitchen when we visited
it. In the poem referred to he alludes to the quarrels
of the good man and his tipsy wife heard through "the
cracked and crazy wall." He told this story of the tipsy
wife: She sent her son for brush to heat her oven. He
brought such a nice load that she thought it too bad to
waste it in the oven. So she sent her son with it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
grocery, and he brought back the liquor he received in
payment. But this made her short of oven wood, and to
eke out her supply of fuel she burned a loose board of the
cellar stairs. The next time she had occasion to go to
the cellar, she forgot the hiatus she had made and broke
her leg. After Mr. Chase left us, Whittier told me that his
old schoolmate was a nephew of the last person usually
accounted a witch in this neighborhood. She was the wife
of Moses Chase of Rocks Village. Her relatives believed
her a witch, and one of her nieces knocked her down in
the shape of a persistent bug that troubled her. At that
moment it happened that the old woman fell and hurt her
head. The old lady on one occasion went before Squire
Ladd, the blacksmith and Justice of the Peace at the
Rocks, and took her oath that she was not a witch.</p>

<p>We next visited the scene of "In School Days," and
found some traces of the schoolhouse that have since
been obliterated, although a tablet now marks its site.
The door-stone over which the scholars "went storming
out to playing" was still there, and some of the foundation
stones were in place. "Around it still the sumachs"
were growing, and blackberry vines were creeping. Mr.
Whittier gathered a handful of the red sumach, and took
it to Amesbury with him. It remained many days in a
vase in his "garden room." Speaking of his boyhood, he
said he was always glad when it came his turn to stay at
home on First Day. The chaise, driven to Amesbury&mdash;nine
miles&mdash;every First and Fifth Day, fortunately was
not of a capacity to take the whole family at once. This
gave him an occasional opportunity, much enjoyed, to
spend the day musing by the brook, or in the shade of
the oaks and hemlocks on the breezy hilltops, which commanded
a view unsurpassed for beauty. These hills, which
so closely encompass the ancient homestead at the west
and south, are among the highest in the county. From
them one gets glimpses of the ocean in Ipswich Bay, the
undulating hills of Newbury, cultivated to their tops, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
further side of the Merrimac, the southern ranges of the
New Hampshire mountains, and the heights of Wachusett
and Monadnock in Massachusetts. Po Hill, in Amesbury,
under which stands the Quaker meeting-house where
his parents worshiped, shows its great round dome in
the east. He never tired of these views, and celebrated
them in many of his poems. He especially dreaded the
winter drives to meeting. Buffalo robes were not so plenty
in those days as they became a few years later, and our
fathers did not dress so warmly as do we. He was so
stiffened by cold on some of these drives to Amesbury
that he told me "his teeth could not chatter until thawed
out." Winter had its compensations, as he has so well
shown in "Snow-Bound." But it is noticeable that he does
not refer in that poem to the winter drives to meeting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
On one occasion he improved the absence of his parents
on a First Day to go nutting. He climbed a tall walnut,
and had a fall of about twenty feet which came near being
fatal. The Friends did not theoretically hold one day
more sacred than another, and yet theirs was the habit of
the Puritan community, to abstain from all play as well
as from work on the Sabbath, and this fall gave a smart
fillip to the young poet's conscience.</p>

<p>This story illustrating Whittier's popularity when a
child I did not get from him, but is a legend of the neighborhood.
One of their nearest neighbors, a Miss Chase,
had a cherry-tree she guarded with the utmost jealousy.
No bird could alight on it in cherry time, and no boy approach
it, without bringing her to the rescue with a promptness
that frightened them. One day she saw a boy in the
branches of this precious tree, and issued upon the scene
with dire threats. She caught sight of the culprit's face,
and instantly changed her tone: "Oh, is it you, Greenleaf?
Take all the cherries you want!"</p>

<p>The old homestead was an object of interest as far
back as 1842, as is shown by a letter before me, written
by Elizabeth Nicholson of Philadelphia, who asks her
friend, Elizabeth Whittier, for a picture of it: "When
thee come to Philadelphia if thee will bring ever so rough
a sketch of the house where Greenleaf was born, for
Elizabeth Lloyd to copy for my book, why&mdash;we'll be
glad to see thee! I hope for the sake of the picturesque
it is a ruin&mdash;indeed it must be, for Griswold says it has
been in the family a hundred years!" It had then been
in the family for over one hundred and fifty years. The
book referred to by Miss Nicholson was a manuscript
collection of all the verses, published and unpublished,
that Whittier had written at that time&mdash;a notable collection,
now in existence. She had obtained from the poet a
preface in verse for this album, which as it has autobiographical
material, refers to the scenery of his birthplace,
and was never in print, is here given in a version he prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
for another similar album. For this version I am
indebted to the collection made by Mary Pillsbury of
Newbury, which contains other original poems of Whittier
never published:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>In these lines Whittier has told in brief the whole story
of his life, from his early dreaming by this brookside
and at this hearthstone, to the waking of his political
ambitions, and later to his earnest strife to bring up the
world "to higher levels."</p>

<p>It happened that the day on which Whittier visited his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
birthplace for the last time was toward the close of a
spirited political campaign in which Whittier took much
interest, as General Butler was a candidate he was opposing.
Speaking of Butler reminded him of the pet ox of
his boyhood, which had the odd name of "Old Butler,"
between whose horns he would sit as the animal chewed
his cud under the hillside oaks. This was the same ox
that, in rushing down one of these steep hills for salt,
could not stop because of his momentum, but saved his
young master's life by leaping over his head. No doubt
this ox was in mind when he wrote the line just quoted,
"The ox unconscious panted at my side." One story
reminded him of another, and he said this ox was named
for another that had its day in a former generation on a
neighboring farm.</p>

<p>This is the story he told of the original "Old Butler:"
A family named Morse lived not far from here, and included
several boys fond of practical joking. The older
brothers one day bound the youngest upon the back of
the ox, Butler. Frightened by the unusual burden, the
animal dashed away to the woods on Job's Hill. The
lad was fearfully bruised before he was rescued. Indignant
at the treatment he had received, he left home the next
morning, and was not heard from until in his old age he
returned to the Haverhill farm, and found his brothers
still living. They killed for him the fatted calf, and after
the supper, as they sat before the great wood fire, they
talked over the events of their boyhood. One of the brothers
referred to the subject all had hitherto avoided, and
said, "Don't you remember your ride upon Old Butler?"
"Yes, I <i>do</i> remember it," was the answer, "and I don't
thank you for bringing it up at this time." The next
morning he left the place, and was never again heard
from. Mr. Whittier told this story to explain the odd
name he had given his ox.</p>

<p>The story has been often told of Garrison's coming out
to East Haverhill to find a contributor who had interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
him; and it has been stated that the Quaker lad was
called in from work in the field to see the dapper young
editor and his lady friend. He once told me that the
situation was a bit more awkward for him. It happened
that on this eventful morning the young poet had discovered
that a hen had stolen her nest under the barn, and
he was crawling on his hands and knees, digging his dusty
way towards the hen, when his sister Mary came out to
summon him to receive city visitors. It was only by her
urgent persuasion that he was induced to give up burrowing
for the eggs. By making a wide detour, he entered
the house without being seen, and in haste effected a
change of raiment. In telling the story, he said he put on
in his haste a pair of trousers that came scarcely to his
ankles, and he must have been a laughable spectacle.
He would have felt much more at ease if he had come
in just as he was when he emerged from under the barn.
Garrison, with the social tact that ever distinguished him,
put the shy boy at his ease at once.</p>

<p>After the death of their father, Greenleaf and his brother
Franklin for a time worked the farm together, and
when in later life they indulged in reminiscences of this
agricultural experience, this is a story with which the poet
liked to tease his brother: Franklin was sent to swap
cows with a venerable Quaker living at considerable distance
from their homestead. He came back with a beautiful
animal, warranted as he supposed to be a good cow,
and he depended upon a verbal warrant from a member
of a Society which was justly proud of its reliability in all
business transactions. It was soon found that she was
worthless as a milker, and Franklin took her back, demanding
a cancellation of the bargain because the cow
was not as represented. But the old Quaker was ready
for him: "What did I tell thee? Did I say she was a
<i>good</i> cow? No, I told thee she was a <i>harnsome</i> cow&mdash;and
thee cannot deny she <i>is</i> harnsome!"</p>

<p>One of Whittier's ancestors was fined for cutting oaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
on the common. When this fact was discovered, he was
asked if he would wish this circumstance to be omitted in
his biography. "By no means," he said, "tell the whole
story. It shows we had some enterprising ancestors, even
if a bit unscrupulous."</p>

<p>When Whittier last visited his birthplace, ten years
before his death, he was saddened by many evidences he
saw that the estate was not being thriftily managed, and
expressed the wish to buy and restore the place to something
like its condition when it remained in his family.
Not one of his near relatives was then so situated as
to be able to take charge of it, and his idea of again
making it Whittier homestead was reluctantly given up.
When he learned, towards the close of his life, that Mr.
Ordway, Mayor Burnham, and other public-spirited citizens
of Haverhill, proposed to buy and care for the place,
already become a shrine for many visitors, he asked
permission to pay whatever might be needed for its purchase.
He died before negotiations could be completed,
and Hon. James H. Carleton generously bought the
homestead, and transferred the proprietorship to a self-perpetuating
board of nine trustees, viz.: Alfred A. Ordway,
George C. How, Charles Butters, Dudley Porter,
Thomas E. Burnham, Clarence E. Kelley, Susan B. Sanders,
Sarah M. F. Duncan, and Annie W. Frankle. In
the deed of gift the trustees were enjoined "to preserve
as nearly as may be the natural features of the landscape;
preserve and restore the buildings thereon as nearly as
may be in the same condition as when occupied by Whittier;
and to afford all persons, at such suitable times and
under such proper restrictions as said trustees may prescribe,
the right and privilege of access to the same, that
thereby the memory and love for the poet and the man
may be cherished and perpetuated." Mr. Ordway was
made president of the board, and in his hands the office
has been no sinecure. His unflagging zeal and his unerring
good taste have resulted not only in putting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
ancient house into the perfect order of the olden time, but
in fertilizing the wornout fields, and preserving for future
ages one of the finest specimens in the country of the
colonial farmhouse of New England. Mr. Whittier's
niece, to whom he left his house in Amesbury, returned
to the birthplace many of the household treasures that
were carried from there in 1836. The articles in the house
purporting to be Whittier heirlooms may be depended on
as genuine.</p>

<p>I do not think that Whittier was ever aware that Harriet
Livermore, the "not unfeared, half-welcome guest," of
whom he gave such a vivid portrait in "Snow-Bound,"
returned to America from her travels in the Holy Land
at about the time that poem was published, and died the
next year, 1867. I have from good authority this curious
story of her first reading of those lines which meant so
much in a peculiar way to the immortality of her name.
She was ill, and called with a prescription at a drugstore
in Burlington, N. J. It happened that the druggist was a
personal friend of Whittier's&mdash;Mr. Allinson, father of the
lad for whom the poem "My Namesake" was written.
This was in March, 1866, and Whittier had just sent his
friend an early copy of his now famous poem. He had
not had time to open the book when the prescription was
handed him. As it would take considerable time to compound
the medicine, he asked the aged lady to take a seat,
and handed her the book he had just received to read
while waiting. When he gave her the medicine and she
returned the book, he noticed she was much perturbed,
and was mystified by her exclamation: "This book tells
a pack of lies about me!" He naturally supposed she
was crazy, both from her remark and from her appearance.
It was not until some time later that he learned that his
customer was Harriet Livermore herself!</p>

<p>In another New Jersey town was living at the same time
another of the "Snow-Bound" characters,&mdash;the teacher
of the district school, whose name even the poet had forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
when this sketch of him was written. In the last
year of his life Whittier recalled that his name was Haskell,
but could tell me no more, except that he was from
Maine, and was a Dartmouth student. His story is told
in "Life and Letters," and is now referred to only to note
the curious fact that although he lived until 1876, and
was a cultivated man who no doubt was familiar with Whittier's
work, yet he was never aware that he had the poet
for a pupil, and died without knowing that his own portrait
had been drawn by the East Haverhill lad with whom
he had played in this old kitchen. I have this from my
friend, John Townsend Trowbridge, who was personally
acquainted with Haskell in the last years of his life.</p>

<p>It was in 1698, ten years after this house was built,
that the Indians in a foray upon Haverhill burned many
houses and killed or captured forty persons, including
the heroic Hannah Dustin, in whom they caught a veritable
tartar. Her statue with uplifted tomahawk stands
in front of the City Hall. It is possible that on her return
to Haverhill she brought her ten Indian scalps into
this kitchen.</p>

<p>Whittier used to tell many amusing stories of his boyhood
days. Here is one he heard in the old kitchen of
the Whittier homestead at Haverhill, as told by the aged
pastor of the Congregational church in the neighborhood,
who used to call upon the Quaker family as if they belonged
to his parish. These extra-official visits were much
prized, especially by the boys, for he told them many a
tale of his own boyhood in Revolutionary times. This
story of "the power of figures" I can give almost in
Whittier's words, as I made notes while he was telling it:</p>

<p>The old clergyman sat by the kitchen fire with his mug
of cider and told of his college life. He was a poor student,
and when he went home at vacation time, he tramped
the long journey on foot, stopping at hospitable farmhouses
on the way for refreshment. One evening an old
farmer invited him in, and as they sat by the fire, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
a good supper, they talked of the things the student was
learning at college. At length the farmer suggested:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No doubt you know the power of figures?"</p>

<p>The student modestly allowed he had learned something
of algebra and some branches of the higher mathematics.</p>

</div>





<p>"I know it! I know it! You are just the man I want to
see. You know the power of figures! I have lost a cow;
now use your power of figures and find her for me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>The student disclaimed such power, but it was of no
use. The farmer insisted that one who knew the power of
figures must be able to locate his cow. Else, of what use
to go to college; why not stay at home and find the cows
after the manner of the unlearned? So the student decided
to quiz a little. He took a piece of chalk and drew crazy
diagrams on the floor. The farmer thought he recognized
in the lines the roads and fences of the vicinity, rubbed
his hands, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are coming to it! Don't tell me you don't know
the power of figures!"</p>

<p>At last, when the poor student had exhausted the power
of his invention, he threw down the chalk, and pointing
to the spot where it fell, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your cow is there!"</p>

<p>He had a good bed, but could not rest easy on it for
the thought of how he was to get out of the scrape in the
morning, when it would be surely known that his figures
had lied. He decided that he would steal off before any
of the family had arisen. In the early dawn he was congratulating
himself upon having got out of the house unobserved,
when he was met at the gate by the old farmer
himself, who was leading the cow home in triumph. He
had found her exactly where the figures had foretold. Of
course the mathematician must go back to breakfast&mdash;what
was he running off for, after doing such a service by
his learning?</p>

<p>They stood again by the cabalistic diagram on the floor
of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"You needn't tell me you don't know the power of
figures," exclaimed the good man, "for the cow was just
there!"</p>

<p>For once, the clergyman said, Satan had done him a
good turn.</p>

<p>Nearly all the early letters and poems of Whittier,
written before he gave up every selfish ambition and
devoted his life to philanthropic work, show how great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
was the change that came over his spirit when about
twenty-five years of age. Before that time he imagined
that the world was treating him harshly, and he was bracing
himself for a contest with it, with a feeling that he
was surrounded by enemies. His tone was almost invariably
pessimistic. After the change referred to, he habitually
saw friends on every side, gave up selfish ambitions,
and a cheerful optimism pervaded his outlook upon life.
The following extract from a letter written in April, 1831,
while editing the "New England Review," to a literary
lady in New Haven, is in the prevailing tone of what he
wrote in the earlier period. This letter has only lately
come into my possession, and is now first quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Disappointment in a thousand ways has gone over
my heart, and left it dust. Yet I still look forward with
high anticipations. I have placed the goal of my ambitions
high&mdash;but with the blessing of God it shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
reached. The world has at last breathed into my bosom
a portion of its own bitterness, and I now feel as if I
would wrestle manfully in the strife of men. If my life is
spared, the world shall know me in a loftier capacity than
<i>as a writer of rhymes</i>. [The italics are his own.] There&mdash;is
not that boasting?&mdash;But I have said it with a strong
pulse and a swelling heart, and I shall strive to realize
it."</p></div>

<p>In another letter, written at about the same time to the
same correspondent, he says: "As for tears, I have not
shed anything of the kind since my last flogging under
the birchen despotism of the Nadir Shah of our village
school. I have sometimes wished I <i>could</i> shed tears&mdash;especially
when angry with myself or with the world.
There is an iron fixedness about my heart on such occasions
which I would gladly melt away."</p>

<p>From the birthplace to the Amesbury home is a distance
of nine miles, traversed by electric cars in less than
an hour. Midway is the thriving village of Merrimac,
formerly known as West Amesbury. It was at Birchy
Meadow in this vicinity that Whittier taught his first and
only term of district school, in the winter of 1827-28.
The road is at considerable distance from the Merrimac
River, and at several points it surmounts hills which afford
remarkably fine views of the wide and fertile river valley,
with occasional glimpses of the river itself. At Pond Hills,
near the village of Amesbury, the landscape presented to
view is one of the widest and loveliest in all this region.
It is a panorama of the beautifully rounded hills peculiar
to this section, with a tidal river winding among them with
many a graceful curve. The electric road we have taken
is about two miles from the left bank of the river, across
which we look to the Newbury hills, cultivated to their
tops, with here and there a church spire indicating the
location of the distant villages. Every part of this lovely
valley has been commemorated in Whittier's writings,
prose and verse.</p>

<p>If, instead of the trolley, we take the carriage road from
Haverhill along the bank of the river, we soon come to
what are left of "the sycamores," planted in 1739 by
Hugh Tallant, in front of the Saltonstall mansion. This
mansion is now occupied by the Haverhill Historical Society,
and most of the famous row of "Occidental plane-trees"
were cut down many years ago, a sacrifice to street
improvement. Three of the ancient trees still stand, and
will probably round out the second century of their existence.
They are about eighty feet in height, and measure
nearly twenty feet around their trunks. Under these trees
Washington "drew rein," and Whittier repeats the legend
that he said:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"I have seen no prospect fairer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this goodly Eastern land."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>About a mile below on the northeasterly side of Millvale,
a hill picturesquely crowned with pines attracts attention.
This is the Ramoth Hill immortalized in the
lovely poem "My Playmate:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The pines were dark on Ramoth Hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Their song was soft and low.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"And still the pines of Ramoth wood<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are moaning like the sea,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moaning of the sea of change<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Between myself and thee!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Until recently there has been much doubt as to the location
of Ramoth Hill, Whittier himself giving no definite
answer when asked in regard to it. Indeed, the poem as
originally written had the title "Eleanor," and the hill
was given the name of Menahga. But Mr. J. T. Fields, to
whom the manuscript was submitted, did not like this
name, and Whittier changed it to Ramoth, which suited
his editor's taste. Mr. Alfred A. Ordway, the best authority
on all matters pertaining to Whittier's allusions to
places in this region, has discovered that the name Menahga
was given to this particular hill in Haverhill by
Mrs. Mary S. West of Elmwood, one of a family all the
members of which were dear to Whittier from his boyhood
to the close of his life. A letter of Whittier's to
Mrs. West has come to light, written about the time this
poem was composed, in which he commends the selection
of the name of this hill, and intimates that he shall
use it in a poem.</p>

<p>On the Country Bridge road, leading from the birthplace
to Rocks Village, is an ancient edifice, known as the
"Old Garrison House," which is of interest to Whittier-Land
pilgrims because it was the home of Whittier's great-grandmother,
Mary Peaslee, who brought Quakerism into
the Whittier family. Thomas Whittier, the pioneer, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
not belong to the Society of Friends, though favorably
disposed toward the sect. His youngest son, Joseph,
brought the young Quakeress into the family, and their
descendants for several generations, down to the time of
the poet, belonged to the sect founded by her father's
friend, George Fox. Joseph Peaslee built this house with
bricks brought from England before 1675. As it was one
of the largest and strongest houses in the town, in the
time of King Philip's war it was set apart by the town
authorities as a house of refuge for the families of the
neighborhood, and as a rallying point for the troops kept
on the scout. There are many port-holes through its thick
walls.</p>

<p>A little farther on we come to Rocks Village, pictured
so perfectly by Whittier in his poem "The Countess,"
that it will be at once recognized:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Over the wooded northern ridge,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Between its houses brown,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>The bridge across the Merrimac at this point was a covered
and gloomy structure at the time this poem was
written. It has since been partially remodeled, and many
of the houses of the "stranded village," then brown and
paintless, have received modern improvements. But there
is enough of antiquity still clinging to the place to make
it recognizable from Whittier's lines. This was the market
to which the Whittiers brought much of the produce of
their farm to barter for household supplies. This was the
home of Dr. Elias Weld, the "wise old doctor" of "Snow-Bound,"
and it was to him "The Countess" was inscribed&mdash;the
poem which every year brings many visitors hither,
for the grave of the Countess is near.</p>

<p>Whittier was still in his teens when this eccentric physician
left Rocks Village and removed to Hallowell,
Maine, and almost half a century had intervened before he
wrote that remarkable tribute to the friend and benefactor
of his youth, which is found in the prelude to "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Countess." The good old man died at Hudson, Ohio, a
few months after the publication of the lines that meant
so much to his fame, and it is pleasant to know that they
consoled the last hours of his long life. Whittier did not
know whether or not the benefactor of his boyhood was
living in 1863, when he wrote the poem, as is shown in
the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>And yet they were in correspondence in the previous year,
as is shown by the fact that I find in an old album of
Whittier's a photograph labeled by him "Dr. Weld," and
this photograph, I am assured by Mrs. Tracy, a grandniece
of Weld, was taken when he was ninety years of
age. I think it probable that the sending of this photograph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
by the aged physician put Whittier in mind to write
his Rocks Village poem, with the tribute of remembrance
and affection contained in its prelude. As to the ancient
sulky which&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Down the village lanes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragged, like a war-car, captive ills and pains,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>it was a chaise with white canvas top, and the doctor
always dressed in gray, and drove a sober white horse.
I have seen a letter of Whittier's written to Dr. Weld,
then at Hallowell, in March, 1828, in which he says: "I
am happy to think that I am not forgotten by those for
whom I have always entertained the most sincere regard.
I recollect perfectly well that (on one occasion in particular)
after hearing thy animated praises of Milton and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Thomson I attempted to bring a few words to rhyme and
measure; but whether it was poetry run mad, or, as Burns
says, 'something that was rightly neither,' I cannot now
ascertain; I am certain, however, that it was in a great
measure owing to thy admiration of those poets that I
ventured on that path which their memory has hallowed,
in pursuit of&mdash;I myself hardly know what&mdash;time alone
must determine.... I am a tall, dark-complexioned, and,
I am sorry to say, rather ordinary-looking fellow, bashful,
yet proud as any poet should be, and believing with the
honest Scotchman that 'I hae muckle reason to be thankful
that I am as I am.'"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is of interest further to state
that Whittier's life-long friend and co-laborer in the anti-slavery
field, Theodore D. Weld, was a nephew of "the
wise old doctor." Also that another nephew, who was
adopted as a son by the childless physician, was named
"Greenleaf" for the young poet in whom he took so much
interest. The grave of the Countess in the cemetery near
Rocks Village is now better cared for than when the poem
was written. This is not the cemetery referred to in the
poem "The Old Burying-Ground," which is near the East
Haverhill church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1844, Whittier was the Liberty Party candidate for
representative to the General Court from Amesbury, running
against Whig and Democratic candidates. A majority
vote being required there were five attempts to elect,
in each of which Whittier steadily gained, and it was at
last evident he would be elected at the next trial. Whereupon
the two opposing parties united, and the town voted
to have <i>no</i> representative for 1845. This was at the time
of the agitation against the annexation of Texas, and
Whittier was very anxious to be elected. Towns then
paid the salaries of their representatives, and could, if
they chose, remain unrepresented.</p>

<p>At his last visit to his birthplace, in 1882, Whittier
called my attention to the millstone which serves as a
step at the door of the eastern porch, to which reference
is made on page <a href="#Page_18">18</a>. It was soon after this that he wrote
his fine poem "Birchbrook Mill," one stanza of which was
evidently inspired by noticing this doorstep, and by memories
of the mill of his ancestors on Fernside Brook, the
site of which he had so recently visited:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The timbers of that mill have fed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Long since a farmer's fires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His doorsteps are the stones that ground<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The harvest of his sires."<br /></span>

<p>Following down the left bank of the river, we come, near
the village of Amesbury, to a sheltered nook between the
steep northern hill and the broad winding river, known as
"Pleasant Valley." At some points there is scant room
for the river road between the high bluff and the water;
at others a wedge of fertile intervale pushes back the
steep bank. The comfortable houses of an ancient Quaker
settlement are perched and scattered along this road in
picturesque fashion. It was a favorite walk of Whittier
and his sister, and it is commemorated in "The River
Path,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sudden our pathway turned from night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hills swung open to the light;<br /></span>

<p>When Mr. Whittier returned to Amesbury from the last
visit to his birthplace, referred to in the preceding chapter,
it was by the road passing the Old Garrison House,
the Countess' grave, Rocks Village, and Pleasant Valley.
He pointed out each feature of the scene that reminded
him of earlier days. When we came to Pleasant Valley,
he stopped the carriage at a picturesque wooded knoll
between the road and the river, and said that here he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
used to come with his sister to gather harebells. It was
so late in the season that every other flower by the roadside
had been killed by frost; even the goldenrod was
more sere than yellow. But the harebells were fresh in
their delicate beauty, and he gathered a handful of them
which lighted up his "garden room" for several days. I
remember that on this occasion an effect referred to in
"The River Path" was reproduced most beautifully. The
setting sun, hidden to us, illuminated the hills of Newbury:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A tender glow, exceeding fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dream of day without its glare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With us the damp, the chill, the gloom:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With them the sunset's rosy bloom;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"While dark, through willowy vistas seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The river rolled in shade between."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To a friend in Brooklyn who inquired in regard to the
origin of this poem, Mr. Whittier wrote: "The little poem
referred to was suggested by an evening on the Merrimac
River, in company with my dear sister, who is no longer
with me, having crossed the river (as I fervently hope) to
the glorified hills of God."</p>

<p>"The Last Walk in Autumn" is another poem inspired
by the scenery of this locality. At the lower end of this
valley, near the mouth of the Powow, on the edge of the
bluff overlooking the Merrimac, Goody Martin lived more
than two hundred years ago, and the cellar of her house
was still to be seen when, in 1857, Whittier first told the
story of "The Witch's Daughter," the poem now known
as "Mabel Martin." She was the only woman who suffered
death on a charge of witchcraft on the north side of the
Merrimac. One other aged woman in this village was
imprisoned, and would have been put to death, but for the
timely collapse of the persecution. She was the wife of
Judge Bradbury, and lived on the Salisbury side of the
Powow. In his ballad Whittier traces the path he used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
take towards the Goody Martin place, as was his custom
in many of his ballads. One who desires to take this
path can enter upon it at the Union Cemetery, where the
poet is buried. Follow the "level tableland" he describes
towards the Merrimac, looking down at the left into the
deep and picturesque valley of the Powow,&mdash;a charming
view of its placid, winding course after it has made its
plunge of eighty feet over a shoulder of Po Hill,&mdash;until
you</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">... "see the dull plain fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sheer off, steep-slanted, ploughed by all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seasons' rainfalls,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and you look down upon the broad Merrimac seeking
"the wave-sung welcome of the sea." Find a path winding
down the bluff facing the river, half-way down to the hat
factory which is close to the water, and you are upon the
location of Goody Martin's cottage. But no trace is now
to be seen of "the cellar, vine overrun" which the poet
describes.</p>

<p>I visited the spot with the poet on the October day
before referred to, and noted the felicity of his descriptions
of the locality. It is near the river, but high above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
it, and one looks <i>down</i> upon the tops of the willows on
the bank:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"And through the willow-boughs <i>below</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw the rippled waters shine."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Opposite Pleasant Valley, on the Newbury side of the
river, are "The Laurels," "Curson's Mill," and the mouth
of the Artichoke, celebrated in several poems. In June,
when the laurels are in bloom, this shore is well worth
visiting for its natural beauties, as well as for the association
of Whittier's frequent allusion to it in prose as well
as verse. It was for the "Laurel Party," an annual excursion
of his friends to this shore, that he wrote the poems,
"Our River," "Revisited," and "The Laurels." In "June
on the Merrimac" he sings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And here are pictured Artichoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Curson's bowery mill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pleasant Valley smiles between<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The river and the hill."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the stanza preceding this he takes a view down the
Merrimac, past Moulton's Hill in Newbury,&mdash;an eminence
commanding one of the finest views on the river,
formerly crowned with a castle-like structure occupied
for several years as the summer residence of Sir Edward
Thornton,&mdash;to the great bend the river makes in passing
its last rocky barrier at Deer Island. The Hawkswood
oaks are a magnificent feature of the scene. This estate,
on the Amesbury side of the river, was formerly occupied
by Rev. J. C. Fletcher, of Brazilian fame.</p>

<p>The Merrimac, beautiful as are its banks along its entire
course, nowhere presents more picturesque scenery
than where it passes through the deep valley it has worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
for itself between the hills of Amesbury and Newbury,
and especially where its tidal current is parted by the
perpendicular cliffs of Deer Island. At this point the
quaint old chain bridge, built about a century ago, spans
the stream. This island is the home of Harriet Prescott
Spofford, who is referred to in the stanza just quoted.
About forty years ago, it was proposed to build a summer
hotel on this island, which is four or five miles from the
mouth of the Merrimac. I have found among Mr. Whittier's
papers an unfinished poem, protesting against what
he considered a desecration of this spot which always
had a great charm for him. It is likely that the reason
why this poem was never finished or published was because
the project of building a hotel was abandoned. I
have taken the liberty to give as a title for it "The Plaint
of the Merrimac." As it was written in almost undecipherable
hieroglyphics, some of the words are conjectural:&mdash;</p>

<p>Before the chain bridge was built, a ferry was maintained
at the mouth of the Powow, and here Washington
crossed the river at his last visit to New England. It is
said that a French ship lay at the wharf near the ferry,
and displayed the French flag over the American because
of the French feeling against the policy of Washington's
administration. Washington refused to land until the
obnoxious flag was lowered to its proper place.</p>

<p>It was a one-story cottage on Friend Street, Amesbury,
to which the Whittiers came in July, 1836&mdash;a cottage
with but four rooms on the ground floor, and a chamber
in the attic. The sum paid for this cottage, with about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
an acre of land, was twelve hundred dollars. The Haverhill
farm was sold for three thousand dollars. Accustomed
to the comparatively large ancestral home at Haverhill,
it is no wonder that there was at first a feeling of homesickness,
as is evidenced in the diary kept by Elizabeth.
This feeling was naturally intensified by the prolonged
absences of her brother, who from 1836 to 1840 was away
from home most of the time, engaged with his duties as
secretary of the anti-slavery society in New York, and as
editor of the "Pennsylvania Freeman" in Philadelphia.
During these years, the only occupants of the cottage were
Whittier's mother, his sister Elizabeth, and his aunt Mercy,
except when his frequent illnesses, and his interest in the
political events of the North Essex congressional district,
called him home. But in 1840, his residence in Amesbury
became permanent. At about this time he made the tour
of the country with the English philanthropist, Joseph
Sturge, who noticed his straitened circumstances, and out
of the largeness of his heart, in a most delicate way, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
only gave him financial assistance at the time, but seven
years later enabled him to build a two-story ell to the
cottage, and add a story to the eastern half of the original
structure. A small ell of one story, occupying part of the
space of the present "garden room," was built by Mr. Whittier
when he bought the cottage in 1836, and this was aunt
Mercy's room. At the later enlargement of the house this
small room was lengthened, and a chamber built over it.
In the lower floor of this enlarged ell is the room which
has ever since been known as the "garden room," because
it was built into the garden, and a much prized fruit tree
was sacrificed to give it place. The chamber over this
room was occupied by Elizabeth until her death in 1864,
and after that by Mr. Whittier.</p>

<p>While repairs were making in this part of the house in
the summer of 1903, a package of old letters was found
in the wall, bearing the date of 1847, the year when the
enlargement was made. One of them reveals the source
of the money required for the improvement. It was from
Lewis Tappan of New York, the financial backbone of
the anti-slavery society, inclosing a check for arrears of
salary due Whittier for editorial work. Mr. Tappan writes:
"I will ask the executive committee to raise the compensation.
I wish we could pay you according to the real value
of your productions, rather than according to their length....
Inclosed is a check for one hundred dollars. Mr.
Sturge authorizes me to draw on him for one thousand
dollars at any time when you and I should think it could
be judiciously invested in real estate for your family. I
can procure the money in a week by drawing on him.
When you have made up your mind as to the investment,
please let me know."</p>

<p>At this time the poet was feeling the pinch of real poverty
and was living in a little one-story cottage that gave
him no room for a study, and no suitable chamber for a
guest. It was at this time that he received the letter which
contained not only a check for overdue salary, but a promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of a gift of one thousand dollars from his generous
English friend, Joseph Sturge. The result of this beneficence
was the building of the "garden room," to which
thousands of visitors come from all parts of this and other
countries, because in it were written "Snow-Bound," "The
Eternal Goodness," and most of the poems of Whittier's
middle life and old age. Mr. Sturge had sent Whittier six
years earlier a draft for one thousand dollars, intending
it should be used by him in traveling for his health.
But Whittier had given most of this toward the support
of an anti-slavery paper in New York. Two years later
the same generous friend offered to pay all his expenses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
if he would come to England as his guest, an offer he was
obliged to decline. A portrait of Sturge is appropriately
placed in this room. Tappan's letter was written April 21,
1847, and the addition to the cottage was built in the
summer of that year. The whole expense of the improvement
was no doubt covered by Sturge's gift. Other interesting
letters of the same period were included in the
package in the wall.</p>

<p>In a drawer of the desk is a most remarkable album
of autographs of public men, presented to Mr. Whittier
on his eightieth birthday, by the Essex Club. It is a
tribute to the poet signed by every member of the United
States Senate and House of Representatives, the Supreme
Court of the United States, the Governor, ex-Governors,
and Supreme Court of Massachusetts, and all the members
of the Essex Club; also, many distinguished citizens,
such as George Bancroft (who adds to his autograph
"with special good wishes to the coming octogenarian"),
Robert C. Winthrop, Frederick Douglass, and J. G.
Blaine. An eloquent speech of Senator Hoar, who suggested
this unique tribute, is engrossed in the exquisite
penmanship of a colored man, to whom was intrusted
the ornamental pen-work of the whole volume. The congressional
signatures were obtained by Congressman
Coggswell of the Essex district. It is noticeable that no
Southern member declined to sign this tribute to one so
identified with the anti-slavery movement.</p>

<p>The "garden room" remains almost precisely as when
occupied by the poet&mdash;the same chairs, open stove,
books, pictures, and even wall-paper and carpet, remaining
in it as he placed them. In the north window the
flowers pressed between the plates of glass are those
on receipt of which he wrote "The Pressed Gentian." By
the desk is the cane he carried for more than fifty years,
made of wood from his office in Pennsylvania Hall, burned
by a pro-slavery mob in 1838. This is the cane for which
he wrote the poem "The Relic:"&mdash;</p>

<p>He had many canes given him, some valuable, but this
plain stick was the only one he ever carried. With this
cane may be seen one made of oak from the cottage of
Barbara Frietchie&mdash;not, as was erroneously stated in
the biography, a cane carried by the patriotic Barbara.
The portraits he hung in this room are of Garrison,
Thomas Starr King, Emerson, Longfellow, Sturge, "Chinese"
Gordon, and Matthew Franklin Whittier. There
is also a fine picture of his birthplace, a water-color sent
him by Bayard Taylor from the most northern point in
Norway, and a picture, also sent by Bayard Taylor, of the
Rock in El Ghor, on receipt of which the poem of that
title was written. The Norway picture was painted by Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Taylor, and represents the surroundings of the northernmost
church in the world. The mirror in this room is an
heirloom of the Whittier family, dating at least a century
before the birth of the poet. The little table under it is
almost equally old.</p>

<p>The album containing the likeness of Dr. Weld has
also a photograph under which Whittier has written
"Mary E. S. Thomas," and this has a special interest, as
it is a portrait of his relative, schoolmate, and life-long
friend, Mary Emerson Smith, who became the wife of
Judge Thomas of Covington, Ky. She was a granddaughter
of Captain Nehemiah Emerson, who fought at
Bunker Hill, was an officer in the army of Washington,
serving at Valley Forge and at the surrender of Burgoyne,
and her grandmother was Mary Whittier&mdash;a
cousin of the poet's father, whom Whittier used to call
"aunt Mary." For a time, when in his teens, he stayed
at Captain Emerson's, and went to school from there, making
himself useful in doing chores. Mary Smith, then a
young girl, passed much of her time at her grandfather's,
and later was a fellow-student of Whittier's at the Academy.
I think there is now no impropriety in stating that
it is to her that the poem "Memories" refers.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> She was
living at the time when the biography of Whittier was
written, and for that reason her name was not given, but
only a veiled reference in "Life and Letters," as at page
276. During many years of her widowhood she spent the
summer months in New England, and occasionally met
Mr. Whittier at the mountains. They were in friendly
correspondence to the close of his life. She survived him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
several years. It has been suggested with some show of
probability that it is a memory of the days they spent together
at her grandfather's that is embodied in the poem
"My Playmate." At the time when this poem was written
she was living in Kentucky.</p>

</div></div>

<p>But this poem, like others of Whittier's, is probably a
composite of memories and largely imaginative, as is
shown in what is elsewhere said about the localities of
Ramoth Hill and Folly Mill.</p>

<p>In the "garden room" also is a miniature on ivory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
a beautiful girl of seventeen, crowned with roses. This is
Evelina Bray of Marblehead, a classmate of Whittier's at
the Academy in the year 1827, when this portrait was
painted. But for adverse circumstances, the school acquaintance
which led to a warm attachment between them
might have resulted in marriage. But the case was hopeless
from the first. He was but nineteen years old, and
she seventeen. On both sides the families opposed the
match. Among the Quakers marriage "outside of society"
was not to be thought of in those days; in his case it
would mean the breaking up of a family circle dependent
on him, and a severance from his loved mother and sister.
This same reason prevented the ripening of other attachments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in later life; for in each case his choice would
have been "out of society." Two or three years after
they parted at the close of
an Academy term, he walked
from Salem to Marblehead
before breakfast on a June
morning, to see his schoolmate.
He was then editing
the "American Manufacturer,"
in Boston. She could
not invite him in, and they
walked to the old ruined fort,
and sat on the rocks overlooking
the beautiful harbor.
This meeting is commemorated
in three stanzas of one
of the loveliest of his poems,
"A Sea Dream"&mdash;a poem,
by the way, not as a whole
referring to Marblehead or to the friend of his youth.
But I have good authority for the statement that these
three stanzas refer directly to the Marblehead incident.
All who are familiar with the locality will recognize it in
these verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>With a single exception, these schoolmates did not meet
again for more than fifty years, and Whittier was never
aware of this exception. In middle life, when the poet
was editing the "Pennsylvania Freeman," and Miss Bray
was engaged with Catherine Beecher in educational work,
they once happened to sit side by side in the pew of a
Philadelphia church, but he left without recognizing her,
and she was too shy to speak to him. I had the story
from a lady who as a little girl sat in the pew with them,
and knew them both. Miss Bray married an Englishman
named Downey, and in a romantic way<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Mr. Whittier
discovered her address. Mr. Downey was an evangelist
making a crusade in the great cities against Romanism,
and met his death from wounds received in facing a New
York mob. Whittier, supposing he was poor, and that his
schoolmate was having a hard time, sent Downey money
without her knowledge. She accidentally discovered this
and returned the money. In her widowhood she occasionally
corresponded with Mr. Whittier, who induced her to
come to the reunion of his schoolmates in 1885, more
than fifty years after their parting at Marblehead, and
more than forty years after the chance meeting in Philadelphia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
At this reunion she gave him the miniature
reproduced in our engraving, which was returned to her
after Whittier's death. When she died it went to another
schoolmate, the wife of Rev. Dr. S. F. Smith, author of
our national hymn. From her it came to Whittier's niece,
and is now kept in the drawer where the poet originally
placed it. With it is the first portrait ever taken of Whittier&mdash;it
being painted by the same artist (J. S. Porter)
two or three years after the girl's miniature, while he was
editing the "Manufacturer."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>Here is an extract from a note Whittier sent Mrs.
Downey soon after the reunion: "Let me thank thee for
the picture thee so kindly left with me. The sweet, lovely
girl face takes me back to the dear old days, as I look at
it. I wish I could give thee something half as valuable in
return." The portrait of Mrs. Downey at the age of eighty,
here given, is from a photograph she contributed to an
album presented to Whittier by his schoolmates of 1827,
after the reunion of 1885. Rev. Dr. S. F. Smith attended
this reunion in place of his wife, who was then an invalid,
and he wrote to his wife this account of the appearance
of her old schoolmate at that meeting: "She looked, O so
<i>distingué</i>, in black silk, with a white muslin veil, reaching
over the silver head and down below the shoulders. Just
as if she were a Romish Madonna, who had stepped out
from an old church painting to hold an hour's communion
with earth."</p>

<p>I was in correspondence with Mrs. Downey during the
last years of her life, but she would not give me permission
to call upon her, and the reason given was that I had seen
the miniature, and she preferred to be remembered by that.
She was very shy about telling of her early acquaintance
with Whittier, and whatever I could learn was by indirection.
For instance, I obtained the Marblehead story by
her sending me a copy of Whittier's poems which he had
given her, and she had drawn a line around the stanzas
quoted above. No word accompanied the book. Of course
I guessed what she meant, and asked if my guess was correct.
She replied "Yes," and no more. Whittier said he
had the Captain Ireson story from a schoolmate who came
from Marblehead. I asked her if she, as the only Marblehead
schoolmate, was the person referred to, and received
an emphatic "No." To an intimate friend she once said
that during her early acquaintance with Whittier it seemed
as if the devil kept whispering to her, "He is only a shoemaker!"</p>

<p>The apartment now used as a reception room was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
kitchen of the original cottage, and has the large fireplace
and brick oven that were universal in houses built a
century ago. A small kitchen was later built as an ell,
and this central room became the dining room, remaining
so as long as Mr. Whittier lived. In the reception
room is a large bookcase filled with a part of the poet's
library, exactly as when he was living here. His books
overrun all the rooms in the house, and many are packed
in closets. The large engraving of Lincoln over the mantel
is an artist's proof, and was placed there by Whittier
forty years ago. An ancient mirror in this room, surmounted
by a gilt eagle, was broken by a lightning stroke
in September, 1872. The track of the electrical current
may still be seen in the blackening of a gilt moulding in
the upper left corner. The broken glass fell over a member
of the family sitting under it, and Whittier himself,
who was standing near the door of the "garden room," was
thrown to the floor. All in the house were stunned and
remained deafened for several minutes, but no one was
seriously injured. Up to that time the house had been
protected by lightning rods; but Mr. Whittier now had
them removed, and refused to have them replaced, though
much solicited by agents. In revenge, one of the persistent
brotherhood issued a circular having a picture of
this house with a thunderbolt descending upon it, as an
awful warning against neglect! He had the impudence to
emphasize his fulmination by printing a portrait of the
poet, who, it was intimated, would yet be punished for
defying the elements.</p>

<p>The old parlor, the principal room of the original cottage,
has suffered no change in the several remodelings of
the house. The beams in the corners show a frame of the
olden style&mdash;for the cottage had been built many years
when the Whittiers came here. The clear pine boards
in the dado are two feet in width. In this room are placed
many memorials of the poet of interest to visitors. What
to him was the most precious thing in the house is the portrait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of his mother over the mantel&mdash;a work of art that
holds the attention of the most casual visitor. The likeness
to her distinguished son is remarked by all. One sees
strength of character in the beautiful face, and a dignity
that is softened by sweetness and serenity of spirit. The
plain lace cap, white kerchief, drab shawl, and folded hands
typify all the Quaker virtues that were preëminently hers.</p>

<p>On the opposite wall is the crayon likeness of Elizabeth,
the dearly loved sister, so tenderly apostrophized in
"Snow-Bound:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I cannot feel that thou art far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since near at need the angels are;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the sunset gates unbar,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shall I not see thee waiting stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, white against the evening star,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The welcome of thy beckoning hand?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When she died, in 1864, her friend, Lucy Larcom, had
this excellent portrait made and presented it to the bereaved
brother, and it has hung on this wall nearly forty
years. All the other members of the "Snow-Bound" family
are here represented by portraits, except the father and
uncle Moses, of whom no likenesses exist, save as found
in the poet's lines. The Hoit portrait of Whittier, painted
when he was about forty years of age, was kept out of
sight in a seldom-used chamber, while the poet was living,
for he allowed no picture of himself to be prominently
displayed. The portrait of his brother was painted when
he was about forty years of age. A small photograph of
his older sister, Mary Caldwell, is shown, and a silhouette
of aunt Mercy; also a portrait of his brother's daughter,
Elizabeth (Mrs. Pickard), who was a member of his household
for twenty years, and to whom he left this house and
its contents by his will. Her son Greenleaf, to whom
when four years of age his granduncle inscribed the
poem "A Name," now resides here.</p>

<p>In this parlor is the desk on which "Snow-Bound" was
written, also "The Tent on the Beach" and other poems of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
this period. The success of these poems enabled him to
buy a somewhat better desk, now to be seen in the "garden
room," where this desk formerly stood. In this desk are
presentation copies of many books, with the autographs
of their authors&mdash;Harriet Beecher Stowe, Lydia Maria
Child, Miss Mitford, Julia Ward Howe, John Hay, T. B.
Aldrich, and others. Here also is the diary kept by Elizabeth
Whittier, in the years 1835-37, covering the period
of the removal from Haverhill to Amesbury. Of antiquarian
interest is an account-book of the Whittier family,
from 1786 to 1800, going into minute details of household
expenses, and containing many times repeated the autographs
of Whittier's grandfather, his father, and his uncles
Moses and Obadiah, who recorded their annual settlements
of accounts in this book. Near the desk are bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
volumes of papers edited by Whittier&mdash;the "New England
Review" of 1830, the "Pennsylvania Freeman" of 1840,
and the "National Era" of 1847-50. These contain much
of his prose and verse never collected. The Rogers group
of statuary representing Whittier, Beecher, and Garrison
listening to the story of a fugitive slave girl, who holds
an infant in her arms, is in the corner of the room, where
it has been for about thirty years. The garden, in the
care of which Mr. Whittier took much pleasure, comprises
about one half acre of land. He had peach, apple, and
pear trees&mdash;but the peaches gave out and were not renewed.
He also raised grapes, quinces, and small fruit
in abundance. The rosebush he prized as his mother's
favorite is still flourishing, as are also the fine magnolia,
laburnum, and cut-leaved birch of his planting. The ash
tree in front of the house was planted by his mother.</p>

<p>While gathering grapes in an arbor in this garden, in
1847, Mr. Whittier received a bullet wound in the cheek.
Two boys were firing at a mark on the grounds of a
neighbor, and this mark was near where Whittier stood,
but on account of a high fence they did not see him.
When the bullet struck him, he was so concerned lest his
mother should be alarmed by the accident that he said
nothing, not even notifying the boys. He bound up his
bleeding face in a handkerchief and called on Dr. Sparhawk,
who lived near. As soon as the wound was dressed,
he came home and gave his family their first notice of the
accident. The boys had not then learned the result of
their carelessness. The lad who fired the gun was named
Philip Butler, and he has since acquired a high reputation
as an artist. The painting representing the Haverhill
homestead which is to be seen at the birthplace was executed
by this artist. He tells of the kindness with which
Whittier received his tearful confession. It was during
the first days of the Mexican war, and some of the papers
humorously commented upon it as a singular fact that
the first blood drawn was from the veins of a Quaker who
had so actively opposed entering upon that war.</p>

<p>Once while his guest at Amesbury, I went with him to
town meeting. He was one of the first men in the town to
vote that morning, and after voting spent an hour talking
politics with his townsmen. General C., his candidate for
Congress, had been intemperate, and the temperance men
were making that excuse for voting in favor of Colonel F.,
who, Whittier said, always drank twice as much as C., but
was harder headed and stood it better. Other candidates
were being scratched for reasons as flimsy, and our Grand
Old Man was getting disgusted with the Grand Old Party,
as represented at that meeting. He said to a friend he
met, "The Republicans are scratching like wild cats."
In the evening an old friend and neighbor called on him,
and was complaining of Blaine and other party leaders.
At last Mr. Whittier said, "Friend Turner, has thee met
many angels and saints in thy dealings with either of the
parties? Thy experience should teach thee not to expect
too much of human nature." On the same evening he told
of a call Mr. Blaine made upon him some time previously.
The charm of his manner, he said, recalled that of Henry
Clay, as he remembered him. On that occasion Blaine
made a suggestion for the improvement of a verse in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
poem "Among the Hills," which Whittier adopted. The
verse is descriptive of a country maiden, who was said
to be</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Not beautiful in curve and line."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Blaine suggested as an amendment,&mdash;</p>

<span class="i2">"Not <i>fair alone</i> in curve and line;"<br /></span>

<p>Thomas Wentworth Higginson, during his residence
in Newburyport, was often a guest at the Amesbury home,
and he has this to say of each member of the family:
"The three members of the family formed a perfect combination
of wholly varying temperaments. Mrs. Whittier
was placid, strong, sensible, an exquisite housekeeper
and 'provider;' it seems to me that I have since seen
no whiteness to be compared to the snow of her table-cloths
and napkins. But her soul was of the same hue;
and all worldly conditions and all the fame of her children&mdash;for
Elizabeth Whittier then shared the fame&mdash;were to
her wholly subordinate things, to be taken as the Lord
gave. On one point only this blameless soul seemed to
have a shadow of solicitude, this being the new wonder
of Spiritualism, just dawning on the world. I never went
to the house that there did not come from the gentle lady,
very soon, a placid inquiry from behind her knitting-needles,
'Has thee any farther information to give in regard
to the spiritual communications, as they call them?'
But if I attempted to treat seriously a matter which then,
as now, puzzled most inquirers by its perplexing details,
there would come some keen thrust from Elizabeth Whittier
which would throw all serious solution further off than
ever. She was indeed a brilliant person, unsurpassed in
my memory for the light cavalry charges of wit; as unlike
her mother and brother as if she had been born into a
different race. Instead of his regular features she had a
wild, bird-like look, with prominent nose and large liquid
dark eyes, whose expression vibrated every instant between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
melting softness and impetuous wit; there was
nothing about her that was not sweet and kindly, but you
were constantly taxed to keep up with her sallies and hold
your own; while her graver brother listened with delighted
admiration, and rubbed his hands over bits of merry sarcasm
which were utterly alien to his own vein."</p>

<p>The village of Amesbury enjoyed a sense of proprietorship
in Whittier which it never lost, even when Danvers
claimed him for a part of each year. He did not give up
the old house, consecrated by memories of his mother and
sister, but returned to it oftener and oftener in his last
years, and he hoped that he might spend his last days on
earth where his mother and sister died. The feeling of the
people of Amesbury was expressed in a poem written by
a neighbor, and published in the village paper, under the
title of "Ours," some stanzas of which are here given:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Friends' meeting-house, in 1836, was nearly opposite
the Whittier cottage, on the site of the present French
Catholic church. Two centuries ago there had been an
earlier meeting-house of the Society, also on Friend
Street, and the name of the street was given on this account.
The present meeting-house, on the same street,
was built in 1851, upon plans made by Mr. Whittier, who
was chairman of the committee having it in charge. He
once told me that some conservative Friends were worried
lest he make the house too ornate. To satisfy them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
he employed three venerable carpenters, one of them a
Quaker minister and the other two elders of the Society,
and the result was this perfectly plain, neat structure,
comfortable in all its appointments. Visitors like to find
the seat usually occupied by Whittier. It is now marked
by a silver plate. I have accompanied him to a First Day
service here, in which for a half hour no one was moved
to say a word. And this was the kind of service he much
preferred to one in which the time was "fully occupied."
The meeting was dismissed without a spoken word, the
signal being the shaking of hands by two of the elders
on the "facing seats." Then each worshiper shook the
hand of the person next him. There was no sudden separation.
The company formed itself into groups for a
pleasant social reunion. In the group that surrounded
Whittier were ten or twelve octogenarians, whom he told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
me he had met in this way almost every week since his
boyhood; for even when living in Haverhill, this was the
meeting his family attended. It was delightful to see the
warmth and tenderness of the greetings of these venerable
life-long friends. I once accompanied him to a devotional
meeting, where many of the leading Friends of the
Society were present, and as the papers had announced
the names of several speakers from distant States, he expressed
the fear that there would be no opportunity to
get "into the quiet." As the speakers followed each
other in rapid succession, he asked me if I had a bit of
paper and a pencil with me. Then he appeared to be
taking notes of the proceedings. I fancied some of the
speakers noticed his pencil, and were spurred by it to
an enlargement of utterance. When we were at home,
I asked what he had written. He smiled and handed
me his "notes," which are before me as I write. "Man
spoke," "Woman sang," "Man prayed," and so on for no
less than fourteen items. Being slightly deaf, he had heard
scarcely anything, and had been noting the number and
variety of the performances. It was his protest against
much speaking. At dinner the same day, his cousin, Joseph
Cartland, commented upon the inarticulate sounds
that accompanied the remarks of one or two of the speakers.
"Let us shame them out of it," he said, "let's call
it grunting." "Oh, no, Joseph," said Whittier, "don't thee
do that&mdash;take away the grunt, and nothing is left!"</p>

<p>Mr. Whittier had many wonderful stories illustrating the
guidance of the spirit to which members of the Society of
Friends submitted in the daily intercourse of life. One was
of an aged Friend, who never failed to attend meeting on
First Day. But one morning he told his wife that he was
impelled to take a walk instead of going to meeting, and he
knew not whither he should go. He went into the country
some distance and came to a lane which led to a house.
He was impressed to take this lane, and soon reached a
house where a funeral service was in progress. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
close of the service he arose, and said that he knew nothing
of the circumstances connected with the death of
the young woman lying in the casket, but he was impelled
to say that she had been accused of something of
which she was not guilty, and the false accusation had hastened
her death. Then he added that there was a person
in the room who knew she was not guilty, and called upon
this person, whoever it might be, to vindicate the character
of the deceased. After a solemn pause, a woman arose
and confessed she had slandered the dead girl. In telling
such stories as this, Mr. Whittier did not usually express
full and unreserved belief in their truth, but he maintained
the attitude of readiness to believe anything of
this kind which was well authenticated, and he approved
of the methods of work adopted by the Society for Psychical
Research in England and in this country.</p>

<p>The hills encircling the lovely valley of the short and
busy Powow River, beginning with the southwestern extremity
of the amphitheatre, are: Bailey's, on the declivity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of which, overlooking the Merrimac, is the site of
Goody Martin's cottage, the scene of the poem of "Mabel
Martin;" next is the ridge on which is the Union
Cemetery where Whittier is buried; then Whittier Hill,
named not for the poet but for his first American ancestor
who settled here, and locally called "Whitcher Hill"&mdash;showing
the ancient pronunciation of the name; then,
across the Powow, are Po, Mundy, Brown's, and Rocky
hills. On a lower terrace of the Union Cemetery ridge,
and near the cemetery, is the Macy house, built before
1654 by Thomas Macy, first town clerk of Amesbury (and
ancestor of Edwin M. Stanton, the great war secretary),
who was driven from the town for harboring a proscribed
Quaker in 1659, as told in the poem "The Exiles;"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
also, the birthplace of Josiah Bartlett, first signer of
the Declaration of Independence after Hancock, whose
statue, given by Jacob R. Huntington, a public-spirited
citizen of Amesbury, stands in Huntington Square; and
near by is "The Captain's Well," dug by Valentine Bagley
in pursuance of a vow, as told in Whittier's poem;
also the Home for Aged Women, for which Whittier left
by his will nearly $10,000. It is to a view of Newburyport
as seen from Whittier Hill, a distance of five miles,
that the opening lines of "The Preacher" refer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Far down the vale, my friend and I<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beheld the old and quiet town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ghostly sails that out at sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flapped their white wings of mystery;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beaches glimmering in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the low wooded capes that run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the sea-mist north and south;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sand-bluffs at the river's mouth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swinging chain-bridge, and, afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foam line of the harbor-bar."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The cemetery in which Whittier is buried can be reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
by either the electric line from Merrimac, or the one from
Newburyport&mdash;the latter approaching nearest the part in
which is the Whittier lot. This lot is in the section reserved
for the Society of Friends, and is surrounded
by a well-kept hedge of arbor vitæ. Here is buried
each member of the family commemorated in the poem
"Snow-Bound," and also the niece of the poet, who was
for twenty years a member of his household. There is a
row of nine plain marble tablets, much alike, with Whittier's
slightly the largest. At the corner where his brother
is buried is a tall cedar, and at the foot of his own grave
is another symmetrical tree of the same kind. Between
him and his brother lie their father and mother, their two
sisters, their uncle Moses and aunt Mercy. His niece,
daughter of his brother, has a place by his side. Inclosed
by the same hedge is the burial lot of his dearly-loved
cousin, Joseph Cartland. For those who take note of
dates it may be said that his father died in 1830, and not,
as stated on his headstone, one year later.</p>

<p>Po Hill, originally called Powow, because of the tradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
that the Indians used to hold their powwows upon its
summit, is three hundred and thirty-two feet high, and
commands a view so extended that many visitors make
the ascent. One of Whittier's early prose legends is of a
bewitched Yankee whose runaway horse took him to the
top of this hill into a midnight powwow of Indian ghosts.
In describing the hill he says: "It is a landmark to the
skippers of the coasting craft that sail up Newburyport
harbor, and strikes the eye by its abrupt elevation and
orbicular shape, the outlines being as regular as if struck
off by the sweep of a compass." From it in a clear day
may be seen Mount Washington, ninety-eight miles away;
the Ossipee range; Passaconaway; Whiteface; Kearsarge
in Warner; Monadnock; Wachusett; Agamenticus and
Bonny Beag in Maine; the Isles of Shoals with White
Island light; Boon Island in Maine; and nearer at hand
Newburyport with its harbor and bay; Plum Island; Cape
Ann; Salisbury and Hampton beaches; Boar's Head and
Little Boar's Head; Crane Neck and many other of the
beautiful hills of Newbury, Rowley, Ipswich, and Danvers.
The view of Cape Ann as seen from Po Hill is
referred to by Whittier at the opening of the poem "The
Garrison of Cape Ann:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From the hills of home forth looking, far beneath the tent-like span<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the sky, I see the white gleam of the headland of Cape Ann."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Down the south side of the Po flows the Powow River in
a series of cascades, the finest of which are now hidden
by the mills, or arched over by the main street of the
village of Amesbury. The hill is celebrated in several
of Whittier's poems, including "Abram Morrison," "Miriam,"
and "Cobbler Keezar's Vision." The Powow, a
little way above its plunge over the rocks where it gives
power for the mills, flows in front of the Whittier home,
and but the width of a block distant. The surface of
its swift current is but a few feet below the level of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Friend Street. Po Hill rises steeply from its left bank. The
Powow is mentioned in the poem "The Fountain:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>"The Fountain" is a spring that may be found on
the western side of Mundy Hill. The oak mentioned in
this poem is gone, and a willow takes its place. The
Rocky Hill meeting-house is well worth the attention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
visitors, as a well-preserved specimen of the meeting-houses
of the olden time. Its pulpit, pews, and galleries
retain their original form as when built in 1785. It is situated
on the easternmost of the fine circlet of hills that
incloses the valley of the Powow. This hill is well named,
for here the melting glaciers left their most abundant deposit
of boulders. A trolley line from Amesbury to Salisbury
Beach passes this venerable edifice.</p>

<p>Salisbury Beach, now covered with summer cottages,
will hardly be recognized as the place described by Whittier
in his "Tent on the Beach." When that poem was
written, not one of these hundreds of cottages was built,
and those who encamped here brought tents. Hampton
Beach is a continuation of Salisbury Beach beyond the
state line into New Hampshire. It has given its name to
one of the most notable of Whittier's poems, and several
ballads refer to it. "The Wreck of Rivermouth" has for
its scene the mouth of the Hampton River, which, winding
down from the uplands across salt meadows, and
dividing this beach, finds its outlet to the sea. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
northern end of the beach is the picturesque promontory
of Boar's Head, and eastward are seen the Isles of Shoals,
and in the further distance the blue disk of Agamenticus.
Whittier describes the place with his usual exactness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And fair are the sunny isles in view<br /></span>
<span class="i1">East of the grisly Head of the Boar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Agamenticus lifts its blue<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Disk of a cloud the woodlands o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And southerly, when the tide is down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt white sea-waves and sand-hills brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beach-birds dance and the gray gulls wheel<br /></span>

<p>Rev. J. C. Fletcher, in an article published in 1879,
says that he was with Whittier at Salisbury Beach, in
the summer of 1861, when he saw the remarkable mirage
commemorated in these lines in "The Tent on the

<p>Mr. Fletcher was spending several weeks that summer
with his family in a tent on the beach. He says: "Here we
were visited by friends from Newburyport and Amesbury.
None were more welcome than Whittier and his sister,
and two nieces, one of whom, Lizzie, as we called her,
had the beautiful eyes&mdash;the grand features in both the
poet and his sister. Those eyes of his sister Elizabeth
are most touchingly alluded to by Whittier when he refers
to his sister's childhood in the old Snow-bound homestead:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Lifting her large, sweet, asking eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now bathed in the unfading green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And holy peace of Paradise.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"One day, late in the afternoon, I recall how Elizabeth was
enjoying a cup of tea in the family tent, while Whittier
and myself were seated upon a hillock of sand outside.
It had been a peculiarly beautiful day, and as the sun
began to decline, the calm sea was lit up with a dreamy
grandeur wherein there seemed a mingling of rose-tint and
color of pearls. All at once we noticed that the far-off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Isles of Shoals, of which in clear days only the lighthouse
could be seen, were lifted into the air, and the vessels
out at sea were seen floating in the heavens. Whittier
told me that he never before witnessed such a sight. We
called to the friends in the tent to come and enjoy the
scene with us. Elizabeth Whittier was then seeing from
the shore the very island, reduplicated in the sky, where
two years afterwards she met that fatal accident which,
after months of suffering, terminated her existence."</p>

<p>Elizabeth fell upon the rocks at Appledore in August,
1863. It was not thought at the time that she was seriously
injured, and perhaps Mr. Fletcher is wrong in attributing
her death solely to this cause. For many years
before and after the death of his sister, Mr. Whittier spent
some days each summer at Appledore. It was at his insistence
that Celia Thaxter undertook her charming book,
"Among the Isles of Shoals."</p>

<p>Other ballads of this region are "The Changeling,"
and "The New Wife and the Old." The ancient house
which is the scene of the last named poem is still standing,
and may be seen by passengers on the Boston and
Maine road, near the Hampton station. It has a gambrel
roof, and is on the left when the train is going westward.
On the right as the train passes Hampton Falls station
may be seen in the distance, shaded by magnificent elms,
the house of Miss Gove, in which Whittier died. It was
upon these broad meadows and the distant line of the
beach that his eyes rested, when he took his last look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
upon the scenery he loved and has so faithfully pictured
in his verse. The photographs here reproduced were taken
by his grandnephew a few days before his death, and the
last time he stood on the balcony where his form appears.
The room in which he died opens upon this balcony. It
was his cousin, Joseph Cartland, who happened to stand
by his left side when the picture was taken. This house
is worthy of notice aside from its connection with Whittier,
as one of the finest specimens of colonial architecture,
its rooms filled with the furniture and heirlooms of
the ancestors of the present proprietor. A trolley line
from Amesbury now passes the house.</p>

<p>As a coincidence that was at the time considered singular,
the superstition in regard to the matter of thirteen
at table was recalled when Whittier dined for the last
time with his friends. During the summer he had lodged
at the house of Miss Gove, taking his meals with others
of his party in a house adjoining. One evening all had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
taken their places at the table except Mr. Whittier. His
niece noticed there were twelve seated, and without comment
took her plate to a small table in a corner of the
room. When her uncle came in, he said in a cheery way,
"Why, Lizzie, what has thee been doing, that they put
thee in the corner?" Some evasive reply was made, but
probably Mr. Whittier guessed the reason, for he was
well versed in such superstitions, and sometimes laughingly
heeded them. In a few minutes, Mr. Wakeman,
the Baptist clergyman of the village, just returned from
his summer vacation, came in unexpectedly, and took the
thirteenth seat that had just been vacated. Whittier's
grandnephew, to again break the omen, took his plate
over to the table in the corner with his mother. It was
all done in a playful way, but the matter was recalled
while we were at breakfast next morning. The news then
came of the paralysis which had affected Mr. Whittier
while dressing to join us. He never again came to the
dining room. Another incident of the same evening was
more impressive, and remains to this day inexplicable.
After sitting for a while in the parlor conversing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
friends, he took his candle to retire, and as he said "Goodnight"
to his friends, and passed out of the door, an old
clock (the clock over the desk) struck once! It had not
been wound up for years, and as no one present had ever
before heard it strike, it excited surprise&mdash;the more so
as the hands were not in position for striking. It was
an incident that had a marked effect upon a party little
inclined to heed omens; and in many ways, without success,
we tried to get the clock to strike once more.</p>

<p>A beautiful little lake in the northern part of Amesbury,
formerly known as Kimball's Pond, is the scene of
"The Maids of Attitash." Its present name was conferred
by Whittier because huckleberries abound in this
region, and Attitash is the Indian name for this berry.
His poem pictures the maidens with "baskets berry-filled,"
watching</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">... "in idle mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gleam and shade of lake and wood."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a letter to the editor of "The Atlantic" inclosing this
ballad, he says of Attitash: "It is as pretty as St. Mary's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Lake which Wordsworth sings, in fact a great deal prettier.
The glimpse of the Pawtuckaway range of mountains
in Nottingham seen across it is very fine, and it has
noble groves of pines and maples and ash trees." A
trolley line from Amesbury to Haverhill passes this lake;
but this is not the line which passes the Whittier birthplace.</p>

<p>Annually, in the month of May, the Quarterly Meeting
of the Society of Friends is held at Amesbury, and during
the fifty-six years of Mr. Whittier's residence in the village,
this was an occasion on which he kept open house,
and wherever he happened to be, he came home to enjoy
the company of friends, giving up all other engagements.
He could not be detained in Boston or Danvers, or wherever
else he might be, when the time for this meeting
approached. It was an annual event in which his mother
and sister took much interest, and after they passed away,
the custom was maintained with the same spirit of hospitality
with which they had invested it, to the last year
of his life.</p>

<p>Among Mr. Whittier's neighbors was an aged pair, a
brother and sister, whose simple, old-fashioned ways and
quaint conversation he much enjoyed. He thought they
worked harder than they had need to do, as the infirmities
of age fell upon them, for they had accumulated a
competency, and on one occasion he suggested that they
leave for younger hands some of the labor to which they
had been accustomed. But the sister said, "We must lay
by something for our last sickness, and have enough left
to bury us." Whittier replied, "Mary, did thee ever know
any one in his last sickness to stick by the way for want
of funds?" The beautiful public library of Amesbury
was built with the money of this aged pair, whose will was
made at the suggestion of Whittier. Part of the money
Whittier left to hospitals and schools would have been
given to this library, had he not known that it was provided
for by his generous neighbors.</p>

<p>In his poem "The Common Question," Whittier refers
to a saying of his pet parrot, "Charlie," a bird that
afforded him much amusement, and sometimes annoyance,
by his tricks and manners. His long residence in this
Quaker household had the effect to temper his vocabulary,
and he almost forgot some phrases his ungodly captors
had taught him. But there would be occasional relapses.
He had the freedom of the house, for Whittier
objected to having him caged. One Sunday morning,
when people were passing on the way to meeting, Charlie
had gained access to the roof, and mounted one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
chimneys. There he stood, dancing and using language
he unfortunately had not quite forgotten, to the amazement
of the church-goers! Whatever Quaker discipline
he received on this occasion did not cure him of the
chimney habit, but some time later he was effectually
cured; for while dancing on this high perch he fell down
one of the flues and was lost for some days. At last his
stifled voice was heard in the parlor, in the wall over the
mantel. A pole was let down the flue and he was rescued,
but so sadly demoralized that he could only faintly
whisper, "What does Charlie want?" He died from the
effect of this accident, but we will not dismiss him without
another story in which he figures: He had the bad
habit of nipping at the leg of a person whose trousers
happened to be hitched above the top of the boot. One
day Mr. Whittier was being worn out by a prosy harangue
from a visitor who sat in a rocking-chair, and swayed
back and forth as he talked. As he rocked, Whittier
noticed that his trousers were reaching the point of danger,
and now at length he had something that interested
him. Charlie was sidling up unseen by the orator. There
was a little nip followed by a sharp exclamation, and the
thread of the discourse was broken! The relieved poet
now had the floor as an apologist for his discourteous
parrot.</p>

<p>At a time when Salmon P. Chase was in Lincoln's Cabinet,
but was beginning to think of the possibility of supplanting
him at the next presidential election, he visited
Massachusetts, and called upon his old anti-slavery friend,
Mr. Whittier. Chase told him among other things that
he did not like Abraham Lincoln's stories. Whittier said,
"But do they not always have an application, like the
parables?" "Oh, yes," said Chase, "but they are not
decent like the parables!"</p>

<p>Henry Taylor was a village philosopher of Amesbury
given to the discussion of high themes in a somewhat
eccentric manner, and Whittier had a warm side for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
odd characters. Once when Emerson was his guest, he
invited Taylor to meet him, knowing that the Concord
philosopher would be amused if not otherwise interested
in his Amesbury brother. Taylor found him a good listener,
and gave him the full benefit of his theories and
imaginings. Next morning Whittier called on him to inquire
what he thought of Emerson. "Oh," said he, "I
find your friend a very intelligent man. He has adopted
some of my ideas."</p>

<p>The likeness of Whittier on page <a href="#Page_97">97</a> is from a daguerreotype
taken in October, 1856, and has never before been
published in any volume written by or about the poet.
Mr. Thomas E. Boutelle, the artist who took this daguerreotype,
is now living in Amesbury at the age of eighty-five.
He tells me how he happened to get this picture,&mdash;a
rather difficult feat, as it was hard to induce the poet to
sit for his portrait. He had set up a daguerrean saloon in
the little square near Whittier's house, and Whittier often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
came in for a social chat, but persistently refused to give
a sitting. One day he came in with his younger brother
Franklin, whose picture he wanted. When it was finished,
Franklin said, "Now, Greenleaf, I want your picture."
After much persuasion Greenleaf consented, and Mr.
Boutelle showed him the plate before it was fully developed,
with the remark that he thought he could do better
if he might try again. By this bit of strategy he secured
the extra daguerreotype here reproduced, but he took care
not to show it in Amesbury, for fear Whittier would call
it in. He took it to Exeter, N. H., and put it in a show-case
at his door. His saloon was burned, and all he saved
was this show-case and the daguerreotype, which many of
the poet's old friends think to be his best likeness of that
period.</p>

<p>Several of Whittier's poems referring to New Hampshire
scenery celebrate particular trees remarkable for age and
size. For these giants of the primeval forest he ever had
a loving admiration. The great elms that shade the house
in which he died would no doubt have had tribute in verse
if his life had been spared. He invited the attention of
every visitor to them. The immense pine on the Sturtevant
farm, near Centre Harbor, called out a magnificent
tribute in his poem "The Wood Giant." Our engraving
on page <a href="#Page_99">99</a> gives some idea of "the Anakim of pines."
There is a grove at Lee, N. H., on the estate of his dearly-loved
cousins, the Cartlands, to which he refers in his
poem "A Memorial:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>There is a "Whittier Elm" at West Ossipee, and indeed
wherever he chose a summer resort, some wood giant still
bears his name.</p>

<p>Visitors to Whittier-Land will find an excursion to Oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Knoll, in Danvers, to be full of interest. Here the poet,
after the marriage of his niece, spent a large part of each
of the last fifteen years of his life in the family of his
cousins, the Misses Johnson and Mrs. Woodman. Without
giving up his residence in Amesbury, where his house
was always kept open for him during these years by Hon.
George W. Cate, he found in the beautiful seclusion of
the fine estate at Oak Knoll a restful and congenial home.
Many souvenirs of the poet are here treasured, and the
historical associations of the place are worthy of note.
Here lived the Rev. George Burroughs, who suffered death
as a wizard more than two centuries ago. He was a man
of immense strength of muscle, and his astonishing athletic
feats were cited at his trial as evidence of his dealings
with the Evil One. The well of his homestead is shown
under the boughs of an immense elm, and the canopy now
over it was the sounding-board of the pulpit of an ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
church of the parish so unenviably identified with the
witchcraft delusion.</p>

<p>Inquiries are sometimes made in regard to the places
in Boston associated with the memory of Whittier. His
first visit to the city was in his boyhood, when he came as
the guest of Nathaniel Greene, a distant kinsman of his,
who was editor of the "Statesman" and postmaster of
Boston. Many of his earliest poems were published in the
"Statesman" under assumed names, and until lately never
recognized as his. Not one of these juvenile productions,
of which I have happened upon many specimens, was ever
collected. When he was editing the "Manufacturer," he
boarded with the publisher of that paper, Rev. Mr. Collier,
at No. 30 Federal Street. When visiting Boston in
middle life, he felt most at home in the old Marlboro
Hotel on Washington Street. He would often leave the
hotel for a morning walk, and find a hearty welcome at
the breakfast hour from his dear friends, Mr. and Mrs.
James T. Fields, at No. 148 Charles Street. In later life,
at the home of Governor Claflin, at No. 63 Mount Vernon
Street, he was frequently an honored guest. It was here
he first met Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, who gives this account
of their meeting: "On this morning he came in
across the thick carpet with that nervous but soft step
which every one who ever saw him remembers. Straight
as his own pine tree, high of stature, and lofty of mien,
he moved like a flash of light or thought. The first impression
which one received was of such eagerness to see
his friends that his heart outran his feet. He seemed
to suppose that he was receiving, not extending the benediction;
and he offered the delicate tribute to his friend
of allowing him to perceive the sense of debt. It would
have been the subtlest flattery, had he not been the most
honest and straightforward of men. We talked&mdash;how can
I say of what? Or of what not? We talked till our heads
ached and our throats were sore; and when we had finished
we began again. I remember being surprised at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
quick, almost boyish, sense of fun, and at the ease with
which he rose from it into the atmosphere of the gravest,
even the most solemn, discussion. He was a delightful
converser, amusing, restful, stimulating, and inspiring
at once." The winter of 1882-83 he spent at the Winthrop
Hotel, on Bowdoin Street, where the Commonwealth
Hotel now stands.</p>

<p>A visit to Whittier-Land is incomplete if Old Newbury
and Newburyport (originally one town) are left out of the
itinerary. At the celebration of the two hundred and fiftieth
anniversary of the settlement of Newbury, in 1885,
a letter from Whittier was read in which he recites some
of the reasons for his interest in the town. He says: "Although
I can hardly call myself a son of the ancient town,
my grandmother, Sarah Greenleaf of blessed memory, was
its daughter, and I may therefore claim to be its grandson.
Its genial and learned historian, Joshua Coffin, was my
first school-teacher, and all my life I have lived in sight
of its green hills, and in hearing of its Sabbath bells. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
history and legends are familiar to me.... The town
took no part in the witchcraft horror, and got none of
its old women and town charges hanged for witches.
'Goody' Morse had the spirit rappings in her house two
hundred years earlier than the Fox girls did, and somewhat
later a Newbury minister in wig and knee-buckles
rode, Bible in hand, over to Hampton to lay a ghost who
had materialized himself and was stamping up and down
stairs in his military boots.... Whitefield set the example
since followed by the Salvation Army, of preaching in its
streets, and now lies buried under one of the churches with
almost the honor of sainthood. William Lloyd Garrison
was born in Newbury. The town must be regarded as
the Alpha and Omega of the anti-slavery agitation."</p>

<p>The grandmother to whom he refers was born in that
part of the town nearest to his own birthplace. The outlet
to Country Brook is nearly opposite the Greenleaf
place, and Whittier's poem "The Home-Coming of the
Bride" describes the crossing of the river and the bridal
procession up the valley of the lesser stream, a part of
which is known as Millvale because of the mills alluded
to in the poem.</p>

<p>The house in which Garrison was born is on School
Street next to the Old South meeting-house, in which
Whitefield preached, and under the pulpit of which his
bones are deposited. Whitefield died in the house next
to Garrison's birthplace. The ancient Coffin house, built
in 1645, the home of Joshua Coffin, to whom Whittier addressed
his poem "To My Old Schoolmaster," is on High
Street, about half a mile below State Street. Whittier's
cousins, Joseph and Gertrude Cartland, with whom he
spent a large part of the last year of his life, lived at
No. 244 High Street, at the corner of Broad.</p>

WHITTIER'S SENSE OF HUMOR</h2>


<p>Few men of his day, of equal prominence, have been
so greatly misunderstood as Whittier by the public which
knows him only by the writings he allowed to be published.
These reveal him on the one hand as an earnest reformer
bitterly denouncing the sins of a guilty people, and on
the other as a prophet of God, with a message of cheer
to those who turn them from their evil ways. While
slavery existed, he lashed the institution with a whip of
scorpions, and in later years, in poems of exquisite sweetness,
he sang of "The Eternal Goodness," and brought
words of consolation and hope to despairing souls. In
the popular mind there has been built up for him a reputation
for extreme seriousness and even severity. To be
sure, some of the poems in his collected works have witty
and even merry lines, but they usually have a serious
purpose. The real fun and frolic of his nature were
known only to those privileged with his intimacy. He
delighted at times in throwing off his mantle of prophecy,
and unbending even to jollity, in his home life and among
friends. The presence of a stranger was a check to such
exuberance. And it was not from any unsocial habit that
he fell into this restraint. It was because he found that
the unguarded words of a public man are often given a
weight they were not intended to bear. If he unbent as
one might whose every word has not come to be thought
of value, it led to misunderstandings. In his home and
among near friends he revealed a charming readiness to
engage in lively and frolicsome conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>
<p>Some stories illustrating his keen sense of humor, and
specimens of verse written in rollicking vein for special
occasions, which might not properly find place in a serious
attempt at biography, I have thought might be allowed
in such an informal work as this. Few of the lines
I shall here give have ever appeared in any of his collected
works, and some of them were never before in
print. I am sure I do no wrong to his memory in thus
bringing out a phase of his character which could not be
fully treated in biography.</p>

<p>I never heard him laugh aloud, but a merrier face and
an eye that twinkled with livelier glee when thoroughly
amused are not often seen. He would double up with
mirth without uttering a sound,&mdash;his chuckle being visible
instead of audible,&mdash;but this peculiar expression of
jollity was irresistibly infectious. The faculty of seeing
the humorous side of things he considered a blessing to
be coveted, and he had a special pity for that class of
philanthropists who cannot find a laugh in the midst of
the miseries they would alleviate. A laugh rested him,
and any teller of good stories, any writer of lively adventures,
received a hearty greeting from him. He told
Dickens that his "Pickwick Papers" had for years been
his remedy for insomnia, and Sam Weller had helped him
to many an hour of rested nerves. He loved and admired
Longfellow and Lowell, and they were his most cherished
friends, but the lively wit of Holmes had a special charm
for him, and jolly times they had whenever they met.
The witty talk and merry letters of Gail Hamilton, full
as they were of a mad revelry of nonsense, were a great
delight to him. It was not in praise of but in pity for
Charles Sumner that he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Small play of fancy lightened toil;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>As an illustration of his own way of speaking the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
he did <i>not</i> mean, just for fun, take the following: More
than thirty years ago, a Division of the Sons of Temperance
was organized in Amesbury, and his niece, one of
his household, joined it. Her turn came to edit a paper
for the Division, and she asked her uncle to contribute
something. He had often complained in a laughing way
in regard to the late hours of the club, and had threatened
to lock her out. This accounts for the tone of the
following remarkable contribution to temperance literature
from one of the oldest friends of the cause:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whittier's favorite way of enjoying his annual vacation
among the mountains was to go with a party of his relatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and neighbors, and take possession of a little inn at
West Ossipee, known as the "Bearcamp House." Sturtevant's,
at Centre Harbor, was another of his resorts. At
these places his party filled nearly every room. It was
made up largely of young people, full of frolic and love of
adventure. The aged poet could not climb with them to
the tops of the mountains; but he watched their going and
coming with lively interest, and of an evening listened to
their reports and laughed over the effervescence of their
enthusiasm. Two young farmers of West Ossipee, brothers
named Knox, acted as guides to Chocorua. They had
some success as bear hunters, and supplied the inn with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
bear steaks. One day in September, 1876, the Knox
brothers took a party of seven of Whittier's friends to the
top of Chocorua, where they camped for the night among
the traps that had been set for the bears. They heard the
growling of the bears in the night, so the young ladies
reported, with other blood-curdling incidents. Soon after
the Knox brothers gave a husking at their barn,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and the
whole Bearcamp party was invited. Whittier wrote a poem
for the occasion, and induced Lucy Larcom to read it for
him as from an unknown author, although he sat among
the huskers. It was entitled:&mdash;</p>

<p>The next day after the husking, Lucy Larcom and some
others of the party prepared a burlesque literary exercise
for the evening at the inn. She wrote a frolicsome poem,
and others devised telegrams, etc., all of which were to
surprise Whittier, who was to know nothing of the affair
until it came off. When the evening came, the venerable
poet took his usual place next the tongs, and the rest of
the party formed a semicircle around the great fireplace.
On such occasions Whittier always insisted on taking
charge of the fire, as he did in his own home. He
even took upon himself the duty of filling the wood-box.
No one in his presence dared to touch the tongs. By and
by telegrams began to be brought in by the landlord from
ridiculous people in ridiculous situations. Some purported
to come from an old poet who had the misfortune to be
caught by his coat-tails in one of the Knox bear-traps on
Chocorua. It was suggested that he might be the author
of the poem read at the husking. Lucy Larcom, who, by
the way, was another of the writers popularly supposed to
be very serious minded, but who really was known among
her friends as full of fun, read a poem addressed to the
man in the bear-trap, entitled:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i2">He 's writing a poem!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whittier evidently enjoyed the fun, and after the rest had
had their say, he remarked, "That old fellow in the bear-trap
must be <i>in extremis</i>. He ought to make his will.
Suppose we help him out!" He asked one of us to get
pencil and paper and jot down the items of the will, each
to make suggestions. It ended, of course, in his making
the whole will himself, and doing it in verse. It is perhaps
the only poem of his which he never wrote with
his own hand. It came as rapidly as the scribe could take
it. Every one at that fireside was remembered in this
queer will&mdash;even the "boots" of the inn, the stage-driver,
and others who were looking upon the sport from the
doorway.</p>

<p>This is all of the will that was written that evening; but
the next morning, at breakfast, I found under my plate a
note-sheet, with some penciling on it. As I opened it, Mr.
Whittier, with a quizzical look, said, "Thee will notice
that the bear-trap man has added a codicil to his will."
This is the codicil:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p>I had to go back to my editorial desk in Portland that
day, and immediately received there this note from Mr.
Whittier:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. P.</span>,&mdash;Don't print in thy paper my foolish
verses, which thee copied. They are hardly consistent
with my years and 'eminent gravity,' and would make
'the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things.'"</p>

<p>I had no thought at the time of giving to the public this
jolly side of Whittier's character, but do it now with little
misgiving, as it is realized by every one that "a little
nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men."
Whittier's capacity for serious work is well known, and
his love of play never interfered with it. An earnest man
without a sense of humor is a machine without a lubricant,
worn out before its work is done. There can be no
doubt that Whittier owed his length of days to his happy
temperament.</p>

<p>Here is a story of Whittier told by Alice Freeman
Palmer: One evening they sat in Governor Claflin's
library, in Boston, and he was taking his rest telling
ghost stories. Mrs. Claflin had given strict orders that
no visitor be allowed to intrude on Mr. Whittier when
he was resting. Suddenly, at the crisis of a particularly
interesting story, there was a commotion in the hall, and
the rest of that story was not told. A lady had called to
see the poet, and would not be denied. The domestic
could not stop her, and she came straight into the library.
She walked up to Whittier and seized both his hands,
saying, "Mr. Whittier, this is the supreme moment of
my life!" The poor man in his distress blushed like a
school-girl, and shifted from one foot to the other; he
managed to get his hands free, and put them behind him
for further security. And what do you think he said?
All he said was, "Is it?" Miss Freeman thought a third
party in the way, and slipped out. As she was going upstairs,
she heard a quick step behind her, and Whittier
took her by the shoulder and shook her, saying as if angry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
"Alice Freeman, I believe thee has been laughing
at me!" She could not deny it. "What would thee do,
Alice Freeman, if a man thee never saw should come up
in that way to thee, take both hands, and tell thee it was
the supreme moment of his life?"</p>

<p>Probably the most seriously dangerous position in
which he was ever placed was on the occasion of the looting
and burning of Pennsylvania Hall, in the spring of
1838. His editorial office was in the building, and for
two or three days the mob had been threatening its destruction
before they accomplished it. It was not safe for
him to go into the street except in disguise. And yet it
was at this very time that he wrote the following humorous
skit, never before in print. Theodore D. Weld had
the year before made a contract of perpetual bachelorhood
with Whittier, and yet he chose this troublous time
to marry the eloquent South Carolina Quakeress, Angelina
Grimké, who had freed her slaves and come North
to rouse the people, and was creating a sensation on the
lecture platform. Her burning words in Pennsylvania
Hall had helped to make the mob furious. Whittier's
humorous arraignment of his friend for breaking his promise
of celibacy was written at this critical time, and
he was obliged to disguise himself when he carried his
epithalamium on the wedding night to the door of the
bridegroom. He had been invited to assist at the wedding
service, but as the bride was marrying "out of society,"
Whittier's orthodoxy compelled him to decline the invitation.</p>

<p>In 1874, Gail Hamilton's niece was married at her
house in Hamilton, and she sent a grotesque invitation
to Whittier, asking him to come to her wedding, and prescribing
a ridiculous costume he might wear. As a postscript
she mentioned that it was her niece who was to be
married. Whittier sent this reply, pretending not to have
noticed the postscript, but finally waking up to the fact
that she was not herself to be the bride:&mdash;</p>

<p>An aged Quaker friend from England, himself a bachelor,
was once visiting Mr. Whittier, and was shown to his
room by the poet, when the hour for retiring came.
Soon after, he was heard calling to his host in an excited
tone, "Thee has made a mistake, friend Whittier; there
are female garments in my room!" Whittier replied
soothingly, "Thee had better go to bed, Josiah; the
female garments won't hurt thee."</p>

<span class="caption">JOSIAH BARTLETT STATUE, HUNTINGTON SQUARE, AMESBURY</span>
</div>

<p>Here is a specimen of his frolicsome verse written after
he was eighty years of age. It deals largely in personalities,
was meant solely for the perusal of a few friends whom
it pleasantly satirized, and was never before in print. When
the bronze statue of Josiah Bartlett was to be erected in
Amesbury, Whittier of course was called upon for the
dedicatory ode, and he wrote "One of the Signers" for
the occasion. The unveiling of the statue occurred on
the Fourth of July, 1888, and as might have been anticipated,
the poet could not be prevailed upon to be present.
The day before the Fourth he went to Oak Knoll, "so as
to keep in the quiet," he said. But his thoughts were on
the celebration going on at Amesbury, and they took the
form of drollery. He imagined himself occupying the seat
on the platform which had been reserved for him, and
these amusing verses were composed, the satirical allusions
in which would be appreciated by his townspeople.
The president of the day was Hon. E. Moody Boynton, a
descendant of the signer, and the well-known inventor of
the bicycle railway, the "lightning saw," etc. He has the
reputation of having the limberest tongue in New England,
as well as a brain most fertile in invention. The
orator of the day was Hon. Robert T. Davis, then member
of Congress, a former resident of Amesbury, and like
Bartlett a physician. Jacob R. Huntington, to whose liberality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the village is indebted for the statue, is a successful
pioneer in the carriage-building industry of the place.
It was cannily decided to give the statue to the State of
Massachusetts, so as to have an inducement for the Governor
to attend the dedication. Whittier's play on this fact
is in the best vein of his drollery. The statue is of dark
bronze, and this gave a chance for his amusing reference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to the Kingston Democrats, whom he imagined as coming
across the state line to attend the celebration. Dr. Bartlett
was buried in their town. Professor J. W. Churchill,
of Andover, one of the "heretics" of the Seminary, was
to read the poem. The other persons named were eccentric
characters well known in Amesbury:&mdash;</p>

<p>In giving this picture of a poet at play, I have presented
a side of Whittier's character heretofore overlooked, although
to his intimate friends it was ever in evidence. I
think there are few of the lovers of his verse who, if they
are surprised by these revelations, will not also be pleased
to become acquainted with one of his methods of recreation.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>When Edmund Gosse visited this country in 1884, he
called upon Mr. Whittier, and this is the impression he received
of his personality: "The peculiarity of his face rested
in the extraordinarily large and luminous black eyes, set in
black eyebrows, and fringed with thick black eyelashes curiously
curved inward. This bar of vivid black across the
countenance was startlingly contrasted with the bushy snow-white
beard and hair, offering a sort of contradiction which
was surprising and presently pleasing. He struck me as
very gay and cheerful, in spite of his occasional references
to the passage of time and the vanishing of beloved faces.
He even laughed frequently and with a childlike suddenness,
but without a sound. His face had none of the immobility
so frequent with very aged persons; on the contrary, waves
of mood were always sparkling across his features, and
leaving nothing stationary there except the narrow, high,
and strangely receding forehead. His language, very fluent
and easy, had an agreeable touch of the soil, an occasional
rustic note in its elegant colloquialism, that seemed very
pleasant and appropriate, as if it linked him naturally with
the long line of sturdy ancestors of whom he was the final
blossoming. In connection with his poetry, I think it
would be difficult to form in the imagination a figure more
appropriate to Whittier's writings than Whittier himself
proved to be in the flesh."</p>

WHITTIER'S UNCOLLECTED POEMS</h2>


<p>Between the years 1826 and 1835, Mr. Whittier was
writing literally hundreds of poems which he never permitted
to be collected in any edition of his works; and
not only so, but he preserved no copies of them, in later
years destroying such as came to his notice. Some of
these verses went the rounds of the newspaper press of
the country, giving him a widespread reputation as a poet.
But in much of his early work we see traces of ambition
for fame, and a feeling that the world was treating him
harshly. When the change came over his spirit to which
reference has been made in a preceding chapter, sweetening
all the springs of life, he lost interest in these early
productions, some of which were giving him the fame
that in his earlier years he so much craved. It was this
radical change which no doubt influenced him in his
later life to omit from his collected works most of the
verses written previous to it. I have in my possession
more than three hundred poems which I have found in
the files of old newspapers, the great mass of which I
would by no means reproduce, although I find nothing of
which a young writer of that period need be ashamed. A
few of these verses are given below as specimens of the
work he saw fit to discard.</p>

<p>The following poem, written when he was nineteen
years of age, during his first term in the Haverhill Academy,
shows in one or two stanzas the feeling that the
world is giving him the cold shoulder:&mdash;</p>

<p>During the first months of Whittier's editorship of the
"New England Review" at Hartford, his contributions of
verse to that paper were numerous&mdash;in some cases three
of his poems appearing in a single number, as in the
issue of October 18, 1830. Two of these are signed with
his initials, but the one here given has no signature.
That it is his is made evident by the fact that all but one
stanza of it appears in "Moll Pitcher," published two
years later. It was probably because of the self-assertion
of the concluding lines that the omitted stanza was canceled,
and these lines reveal the ambition then stirring
his young blood.</p>

<p>One of the poems in the same number which contained
this spirited tribute to New England was the song given
below, which was signed with the initials of the editor,
else there might be some hesitation in assigning it to him,
for there is scarcely anything like it to be found in his
writings. It was evidently written for music, and some
composer should undertake it.</p>

<p>The "Review" for September 13, 1830, has a poem
of Whittier's prefaced by a curious story about Lord
Byron:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Spectre.</i>&mdash;There is a story going the rounds of our
periodicals that a Miss G., of respectable family, young
and very beautiful, attended Lord Byron for nearly a year
in the habit of a page. Love, desperate and all-engrossing,
seems to have been the cause of her singular conduct.
Neglected at last by the man for whom she had forsaken
all that woman holds dear, she resolved upon self-destruction,
and provided herself with poison. Her designs
were discovered by Lord Byron, who changed the poison
for a sleeping potion. Miss G., with that delicate feeling
of affection which had ever distinguished her intercourse
with Byron, stole privately away to the funeral vault of
the Byrons, and fastened the entrance, resolving to spare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
her lover the dreadful knowledge of her fate. She there
swallowed the supposed poison&mdash;and probably died of
starvation! She was found dead soon after. Lord Byron
never adverted to this subject without a thrill of horror.
The following from his private journal may, perhaps, have
some connection with it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I awoke from a dream&mdash;well! and have not others
dreamed?&mdash;such a dream! I wish the dead would rest
forever. Ugh! how my blood chilled&mdash;and I could not
wake&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Shadows to-night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than could the substance of ten thousand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed all in proof&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I do not like this dream&mdash;I hate its foregone conclusion.
And am I to be shaken by shadows? Ay, when
they remind us of&mdash;no matter&mdash;but if I dream again I
will try whether all sleep has the like visions."&mdash;Moore's
"Byron," page 324.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">She came to me last night&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The floor gave back no tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stood by me in the wan moonlight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the white robes of the dead&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale&mdash;pale, and very mournfully<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bent her light form over me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard no sound&mdash;I felt no breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathe o'er me from that face of death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its dark eyes rested on my own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rayless and cold as eyes of stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet in their fixed, unchanging gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something which told of other days&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sadness in their quiet glare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if Love's smile were frozen there,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O God! I feel its presence still!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fearfully and dimly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pale cold vision passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet those dark eyes were fixed on me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sadness to the last.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I struggled&mdash;and my breath came back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to the victim on the rack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the pause of mortal pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life steals to suffer once again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it a dream? I looked around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moonlight through the lattice shone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same pale glow that dimly crowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forehead of the spectral one!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then I knew she had been there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not in her breathing loveliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as the grave's lone sleepers are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent and cold and passionless!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A weary thought&mdash;a fearful thought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the secret heart to keep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would that the past might be forgot&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would that the dead might sleep!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These are the concluding lines of a long poem written in
1829, while he was editing the "American Manufacturer."
The poem as a whole was never in print; but these lines of
it I find in the "Essex Gazette" of August 22, 1829, from
which paper they were copied, as were most of his productions
of that period, by the newspapers of the country.
They were never in any collection of his works:&mdash;</p>

<p>Many of Whittier's early discarded verses are of a
rather gruesome sort, but more are inspired by contemplation
of sublime themes, like this apostrophe to "Eternity,"
which was published in the "New England Review" in
1831:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1832 a living ichneumon was brought to Haverhill,
and was on exhibition at Frinksborough, a section of
Haverhill now known as "the borough," on the bank of
the river above the railroad bridge. Three young ladies
of Haverhill went to see it, escorted by Mr. Whittier.
They found that the animal had succumbed to the New
England climate, and had just been buried. One of the
ladies, Harriet Minot, afterward Mrs. Pitman, a life-long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
friend of the poet, suggested that he should write an
elegy, and these are the lines he produced:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following poem, which I have never seen in print,
I find in a manuscript collection of Whittier's early poems,
in the possession of his cousin, Ann Wendell, of Philadelphia.
It is a political curiosity, being a reminiscence
of the excitement caused by the mystery of the disappearance
of William Morgan, in the vicinity of Niagara Falls,
in 1826. It was written in 1830, three years before Whittier
became especially active in the anti-slavery cause.
He was then working in the interest of Henry Clay as
against Jackson, and the Whigs had adopted some of the
watchwords of the Anti-Masonic party:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here is a poem of Whittier's that will remind every
reader of the hymn "The Worship of Nature," which
first appeared without a title in the "Tent on the Beach."
And yet there is no line in it, and scarcely a phrase, which
was used in this last named poem. I find it in the "New
England Review," of Hartford, under date of January
24, 1831. It would seem that "The Worship of Nature"
was a favorite theme of his, for a still earlier treatment
of it I have found in the "Haverhill Gazette" of October
5, 1827, written before the poet was twenty years of age.
It is a curious fact that while in the version of 1827 there
are a few lines and phrases which were adopted forty
years afterward, the lines given here are none of them
copied in the final revision of the poem.</p>

<p>This imitation of "The Old Oaken Bucket" was written
in 1826, when Whittier was in his nineteenth year,
and except a single stanza, no part of it was ever before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
in print. The willow the young poet had in mind was on
the bank of Country Brook, near Country Bridge, and
also near the site of Thomas Whittier's log house. Mr.
Whittier once pointed out this spot to me as one in
which he delighted in his youth. On a grassy bank, almost
encircled by a bend in the stream, stood, and perhaps
still stands, just such a "storm-battered, water-washed
willow" as is here described:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">O'ershaded with tall grass, and rapidly flowing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the lone willow that stood by its side&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The grass-shadowed rivulet rapidly glide,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where swift from the far distant uplands descending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the bright sunbeam sparkling, the rivulet's tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With murmuring echoes came gracefully wending<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its course round the willow that stood by its side&mdash;<br /></span>

THE USES OF SORROW</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It may be that tears at whiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should take the place of folly's smiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When 'neath some Heaven-directed blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like those of Horeb's rock, they flow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sorrows are in mercy given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fit the chastened soul for Heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prompting with woe and weariness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our yearning for that better sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, as the shadows close on this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows brighter to the longing eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For each unwelcome blow may break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance, some chain which binds us here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clouds around the heart may make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vision of our faith more clear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As through the shadowy veil of even<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eye looks farthest into Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On gleams of star, and depths of blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fervid sunshine never knew!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the summer of 1856, Charles A. Dana, then one of
the editors of the New York "Tribune," wrote to Whittier,
calling upon him for campaign songs for Fremont. He
said: "A powerful means of exciting and maintaining the
spirit of freedom in the coming decisive contest must be
songs. If we are to conquer, as I trust in God we are, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
great deal must be done by that genial and inspiring
stimulant." Whittier responded with several songs sung
during the campaign for free Kansas, but the following
lines for some reason he desired should appear without
his name, either in the "National Era," in which they
first appeared, August 14, 1856, or with the music to which
they were set. A recently discovered letter, written by him
to a friend in Philadelphia who was intrusted to set the
song to music, avows its authorship, and also credits to
his sister Elizabeth another song, "Fremont's Ride," published
in the same number of the "Era." As the brother
probably had some hand in the composition of this last-mentioned
piece, it is given here. This is Whittier's
song:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following poem was written at the close of his
last term at the Academy, and was published in the "Haverhill
Gazette" of October 4, 1828, signed "Adrian."
Probably no other poem written by him in those days
was so universally copied by the press of the whole country.
Its rather pessimistic tone no doubt caused the
poet to omit it from collections made after the great
change in his outlook upon life to which reference has
been made on another page.</p>

<p>I find among Mr. Whittier's papers the first draft of a
poem that he does not seem to have prepared for publication.
As it was written on the back of a note he received
in March, 1890, that was probably the date of its composition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="titlest">
A SONG OF PRAISES</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For the land that gave me birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my native home and hearth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the change and overturning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the times of my sojourning;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the world-step forward taken;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For an evil way forsaken;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For cruel law abolished;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For idol shrines demolished;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For the tools of peaceful labor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought from broken gun and sabre;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the slave-chain rent asunder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by free feet trodden under;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the truth defeating error;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the love that casts out terror;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the truer, clearer vision<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Humanity's great mission;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For all that man upraises,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I sing this song of praises.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following poem is a variant of the "Hymn for the
Opening of Thomas Starr King's House of Worship,"
and was contributed in 1883 to a fair in aid of an Episcopal
chapel at Holderness, N. H.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="titlewd">
UNITY</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Forgive, O Lord, our severing ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The separate altars that we raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The varying tongues that speak Thy praise!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Suffice it now. In time to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall one great temple rise to Thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy church our broad humanity.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">White flowers of love its walls shall climb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet bells of peace shall ring its chime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its days shall all be holy time.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The hymn, long sought, shall then be heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The music of the world's accord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confessing Christ, the inward word!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That song shall swell from shore to shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One faith, one love, one hope restore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seamless garb that Jesus wore!<br /></span>

Alexander in her exquisite volume, <i>Tuscan Songs</i>. It is the face of
an Italian peasant, but bears so extraordinary a resemblance to
Harriet Livermore (as testified by several who knew her) that it is
here given as representing her better than any known portrait.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This letter has been published in full in a limited
edition, by Mr. Goodspeed, together with a New Year's Address referred
to in it as having given offense to some of the citizens of Rocks
Village. A portion of this Address (which appeared in the <i>Haverhill
Gazette</i>, January 5, 1828) is given in <i>Life and Letters</i>,
pp. 62, 63. The lines that seem to have given offense are these:&mdash;
<br /><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"<i>Rocks</i> folks are wide awake&mdash;their old bridge tumbled</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Some years ago, and left them all forsaken;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">But they have risen, tired of being humbled,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And the first steps towards a new one taken.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">They're all alive&mdash;their trade becomes more clever,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And mobs and riots flourish well as ever."</span><br />
<br />

Thirty-five years later, perhaps remembering the offense he had given
in his youth by his portrayal of the <i>liveliness</i> of the place, he
shaded his picture in <i>The Countess</i> with a different pencil, and we
have a "stranded village" sketched to the life.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> It is of curious interest that although the poem
<i>Memories</i> was first published in 1841, the description of the
"beautiful and happy girl" in its opening lines is identical with that
of one of the characters in <i>Moll Pitcher</i>, published nine years
earlier, and I have authority for saying that Mary Smith was in mind
when that portrait was drawn. Probably the reason why Whittier never
allowed <i>Moll Pitcher</i> to be collected was because he used lines from
it in poems written at later dates.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> This is how it happened: Mr. Downey saw a newspaper item
to the effect that Mrs. S. F. Smith was a classmate of Whittier's. He
knew that his wife was a classmate of Mrs. Smith, and "put this and
that together." Without saying anything to her about it, he sent a
tract of his to Whittier, and with it a note about his work as an
evangelist; in a postscript he said, "Did you ever know Evelina Bray?"
Whittier wrote a criticism of the tract, which was against Colonel
Ingersoll, in which he said, "It occurs to me to say that in thy tract
there is hardly enough charity for that unfortunate man, who, it seems
to me, is much to be pitied for his darkness of unbelief." He added as
a postscript, "What does <i>thee</i> know about Evelina Bray?" Downey
replied that she was his wife, but did not let her know of this
correspondence, or of his receipt of money from her old schoolmate. He
was not poor, only eccentric.</p></div>
